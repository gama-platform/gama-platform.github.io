# Contribute

Since GAMA is a free opensource software, we are proud to share the source code with anyone who wants to contribute to the platform. Note that GAMA is easy to extand through the use of additionnal plugins.

## Developer documentation

A more complete documentation exists on Github at the following address : [https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/wiki](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/wiki). You can find here the last updated version of the documentation (the documentation of the latest git version), and also a [developer documentation](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/wiki/DevelopingExtensions) (which is not available in the "regular" website).

## Source Code

GAMA can be downloaded as a regular application or [built from source](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama), which is necessary if you want to contribute to the platform.
The source code is available from this GITHub repository:

```
https://github.com/gama-platform/gama
```

Which you can also browse from the web [here](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama).
It is, in any case, recommended to follow the instructions on [this page](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/wiki/InstallingGitVersion) in order to build GAMA from source.

## GAMA Dev mailing list

If you want to contribute to the platform, you can send a request to the developping team to be in the [gama-dev@googlegroups.com mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/gama-dev).

## Developers

GAMA is being designed, developed and maintained by an active group of researchers coming from different institutions in France and Vietnam. Please find below a short introduction to each of them and a summary of their contributions to the platform:

* **[Alexis Drogoul](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexis_Drogoul)**, Senior Researcher at the [IRD](http://www.ird.fr), member of the [UMMISCO](http://www.ummisco.ird.fr) International Research Unit. Mostly working on agent-based modeling and simulation. Has contributed and still contributes to the original design of the platform, including the GAML language (from the meta-model to the editor) and simulation facilities like Java2D displays.
* **[Patrick Taillandier](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Patrick_Taillandier)**, Associate Professor at the [University of Rouen](http://www.univ-rouen.fr/), member of the [IDEES](http://www.umr-idees.fr/) CNRS Mixed Research Unit. Contributes since 2008 to the spatial and graph features (GIS integration, spatial operators) and to parameter space search algorithms. Currently working on new features related to graphical modeling and traffic simulation.
* **[Benoit Gaudou](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Benoit_Gaudou)**, Associate Professor at the [University Toulouse 1 Capitole](http://www.ut-capitole.fr/), member of the [IRIT](http://www.irit.fr/) CNRS Mixed Research Unit. Contributes since 2010 to documentation and unit test generation and coupling mathematical (ODE and PDE) and agent paradigms.
* **[Arnaud Grignard](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arnaud_Grignard)**, software engineer and PhD fellow ([PDI-MSC](http://www.ummisco.ird.fr/pdi/)) at [UPMC](http://www.upmc.fr/). Contributes since 2011 to the development of new features related to visualization (3D Display), online analysis and interaction.
* **[Huynh Quang Nghi](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Huynh_Nghi)**, software engineering lecturer at [CTU](http://www.ctu.edu.vn) and PhD fellow ([PDI-MSC](http://www.ummisco.ird.fr/pdi/)) at [UPMC](http://www.upmc.fr/). Contributes since 2012 to the development of new features related to GAML parser, coupling formalisms in EBM-ABM and ABM-ABM.
* **[Truong Minh Thai](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thai_Truong_Minh)**, software engineering lecturer at [CTU](http://www.ctu.edu.vn/) and PhD fellow (PRJ322-MOET) at [IRIT](http://www.irit.fr/)-[UT1](http://www.ut-capitole.fr/). Contributes since 2012 to the development of new features related to data management and analysis.
* **[Nicolas Marilleau](http://www.ummisco.ird.fr/index.php?option=com_members&view=member&uid=62&Itemid=70)**, Researcher at the [IRD](http://www.ird.fr), member of the [UMMISCO](http://www.ummisco.ird.fr) International Research Unit and associate researcher at [DISC](http://disc.univ-fcomte.fr) team of [FEMTO-ST](http://www.femto-st.fr) institute. Contributes since 2010 to the development of headless mode and the high performance computing module.
* **[Philippe Caillou](https://www.lri.fr/~caillou)**, Associate professor at the [University Paris Sud 11](http://www.u-psud.fr), member of the [LRI](http://www.lri.fr) and [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr) project-team [TAO](https://tao.lri.fr/tiki-index.php). Contributes since 2012 and actually working on charts, simulation analysis and BDI agents.
* **[Vo Duc An](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Duc-An_Vo)**, Post-doctoral Researcher, working on synthetic population generation in agent-based modelling, at the [UMMISCO](http://www.ummisco.ird.fr) International Research Unit of the [IRD](http://www.ird.fr). Has contributed to bringing the platform to the Eclipse RCP environment and to the development of several features (e.g., the FIPA-compliant agent communication capability, the multi-level architecture).
* **[Truong Xuan Viet](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Viet_Truong_Xuan)**, software engineering lecturer at [CTU](http://www.ctu.edu.vn) and PhD fellow ([PDI-MSC](http://www.ummisco.ird.fr/pdi/)) at [UPMC](http://www.upmc.fr/).
