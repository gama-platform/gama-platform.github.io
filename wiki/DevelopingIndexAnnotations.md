# Index of annotations



Annotations are used to link Java methods and classes to GAML language.




## @action
This annotations is used to tag a method that will be considered as an action (or primitive) in GAML.
The method must have the following signature: ```
Object methodName(IScope) throws GamaRuntimeException ``` and be contained in a class annotated with [@species](#species) or [@skill](#skill) (or a related class, like a subclass or an interface).

This annotation contains:
  * **name** (String): _the name of the variable as it can be used in GAML_.
  * **virtual** (boolean, false by default): _if true the action is virtual, i.e. equivalent to abstract method in java_.
  * **args** (set of [@arg](#arg), empty by default): _the list of arguments passed to this action. Each argument is an instance of arg_.
  * **doc** (set of [@doc](#doc), empty by default): _the documentation associated to the action_.





## @arg

This annotation contains:
  * **name** (String, "" by default): _the name of the argument as it can be used in GAML_.
  * **type** (set of ints, empty by default): _An array containing the textual representation of the types that can be taken by the argument (see IType)_.
  * **optional** (boolean, true by default): _whether this argument is optional or not_.
  * **doc** (set of [@doc](#doc), empty by default): _the documentation associated to the argument._

This annotation contains:
  * **name** (String): _a (human-understandable) string describing this type of files, suitable for use in composed operator names (e.g. "shape", "image"...).

## @usage
This replaces @special_cases and @examples, and unifies the doc for operators, statements and others.
An @usage can also be used for defining a template for a GAML structure, and in that case requires the following to be defined:
  * A name (attribute "name"), optional, but better
  * A description (attribute "value"), optional
  * A menu name (attribute "menu"), optional
  * A hierarchical path within this menu (attribute "path"), optional
  * A pattern (attribute "pattern" or concatenation of the @example present in "examples" that define "isPattern" as true)

This annotation contains:
  * **value** (String): _a String representing one usage of the keyword. Note that for usages aiming at defining templates, the description is displayed on a tooltip in the editor. The use of the path allows to remove unecessary explanations. For instance, instead of writing : description="This template illustrates the use of a complex form of the "create" statement, which reads agents from a shape file and uses the tabular data of the file to initialize their attributes", choose: name="Create agents from shapefile" menu=STATEMENT; path={"Create", "Complex forms"} description="Read agents from a shape file and initialze their attributes". If no description is provided, GAMA will try to grab it from the context where the template is defined (in the documentation, for example)_.
  * **menu** (String, "" by default): _Define the top-level menu where this template should appear. Users are free to use other names than the provided constants if necessary (i.e. "My templates"). When no menu is defined, GAMA tries to guess it from the context where the template is defined_.
  * **path** (set of Strings, empty be default): The path indicates where to put this template in the menu. For instance, the following annotation: " menu = STATEMENT; path = {"Control", "If"} will put the template in a menu called "If", within "Control", within the top menu "Statement". When no path is defined, GAMA will try to guess it from the context where the template is defined (i.e. keyword of the statement, etc.)
  * **name** (String, "" by default): _The name of the template should be both concise (as it will appear in a menu) and precise (to remove ambiguities between templates)_.
  * **examples** (set of [@example](#example), empty by default): _An array of String representing some examples or use-cases about how to use this element, related to the particular usage above_.
  * **pattern** (String, "" by default): _Alternatively, the contents of the usage can be descried using a @pattern (rather than an array of [@example](#example)). The formatting of this string depends entirely on the user (e.g. including \n and \t for indentation, for instance)_.


## @validator
It allows to declare a custom validator for Symbols (statements, var declarations, species ,experiments, etc.). This validator, if declared on subclasses of Symbol, will be called after the standard validation is done. The validator must be subclass of IDescriptionValidator.
  * **value** (Class): _the validator class_.





## @var
This annotation is used to describe a single variable or field.

This annotation contains:
  * **name** (String): _the name of the variable as it can be used in GAML_.
  * **type** (int): _The textual representation of the type of the variable (see IType)_.
  * **of** (int, 0 by default): _The textual representation of the content type of the variable (see IType#defaultContentType())_.
  * **index** (int, 0 by default): _The textual representation of the index type of the variable (see IType#defaultKeyType())_.
  * **constant** (boolean, false by default): _returns whether or not this variable should be considered as non modifiable_.
  * **init** (String, "" by default): _the initial value of this variable as a String that will be interpreted by GAML_.
  * **depend\_on** (set of Strings, empty by default): _an array of String representing the names of the variables on which this variable depends (so that they are computed before)_.
  * **internal** (boolean, false by default): _return whether this var is for internal use only_.
  * **doc** (set of [@doc](#doc), empty by default): _the documentation associated to the variable_.






## @vars
This annotation is used to describe a set of variables or fields.

This annotation contains:
  * **value** (set of @var): _an Array of var instances, each representing a variable_.
