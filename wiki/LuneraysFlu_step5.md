# 5. Definition of 3D displays
This fifth step illustrates how to define 3D displays

## Formulation
  * Define a new 3D aspect for roads.
  * Define a new 3D aspect for buildings
  * Define a new 3D aspect for people
  * Define a new 3D display 

## Model Definition

### species

First, we add a new variable called _display\_shape_ of type _geometry_ for road agent that is a tube of 2m radius built from its geometry. Note that it is possible to get the list of points composing a geometry by using the _points_ variable of the geometry. We define then an aspect called _geom3D_ that draws the previous geometry in black.

![images/roads_display.tiff](resources/images/tutorials/roads_display.tiff)

```
species road {
	geometry display_shape <- line(shape.points, 2.0);
	
	//....
	aspect geom3D {
		draw display_shape color: #black;
	}
}
```

Concerning the building species, we add a new variable called _height_ of type _float_ that is initialized by a random value between 20 and 40 meters.
We define then an aspect called _geom3D_ that draws the shape of the building with a depth of height and with using a texture ("texture.jpg" that is located inside the includes folder).

![images/buildings_display.tiff](resources/images/tutorials/buildings_display.tiff)

```
species building {
	float height <- 20#m + rnd(20) #m;
	//....
	aspect geom3D {
		draw shape depth: height texture:["../includes/texture.jpg"];
	}
}
```
At last, we define a new aspect called _geom3D_ for the people species that draws first a pyramid of 5 meters size, then a sphere of radius 2 meters at a height of 5m (z = 5). Note that it is possible to access the coordinates of a point by using the _x_, _y_ and _z_ variables. In GAMA, a point can be defined by using the format _{x\_value,y\_value,z\_value}_.

![images/people_display.tiff](resources/images/tutorials/people_display.tiff)

```
species people skills:[moving]{		
	//....
	aspect geom3D{
		draw pyramid(5) color: is_infected ? #red : #green;
		draw sphere(2) at: {location.x,location.y,5} color: is_infected ? #red : #green;	
	}
}
```

### output

We define a new display called _map\_3D_ of type _opengl_ with an _ambient\_light_ of 120 that displays first a image ("soil.jpg"), then the road with the _geom3D_ aspect, then the building with the _geom3D_ aspect, and finally the people with the _geom3D_ aspect. All layers except the people's one will not be refreshed (refresh set to false).

```
experiment main_experiment type: gui {
	output {
	// monitor and other displays	
		display map_3D type: opengl ambient_light: 120 {
			image "../includes/soil.jpg" refresh: false;
			species road aspect:geom3D refresh: false;
			species building aspect:geom3D refresh: false;
			species people aspect:geom3D;			
		}
	}
}
```
