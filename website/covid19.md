	@url : https://gama-platform.github.io/covid19

	How to use :
		- Your answer should be written in the MarkDown format 
			- you can add links, images, lists, etc 
				==> It's like in the wiki
				- For images, you can save them anywhere, but I prepared a folder for this page. So save them in `gama-platform.github.io/website/static/img/covid19/`
			- If you link a page, you should have an explicit link
				=> That page won't scrap page reference automatically like in the rest of the wiki

		- ⚠️ Do not remove the first line "module.exports = `" nor the last line "`;" ⚠️

	Good to Know : 
		- This file is considered as a JavaScript file, but React do not care about the extension. So I named it "faq.md" to not scare you 🐻
		- This file is used by >> `gama-platform.github.io/website/pages/en/covid19.js`
