# Recipes



Understanding the [structure of models](ModelOrganization) in GAML and gaining some insight of [the language](GamlReference) is required, but is usually not sufficient to build correct models or models that need to deal with specific approaches (like [equation-based modeling](Equations)). This section is intended to provide readers with practical "how to"s on various subjects, ranging from the use of [database access](UsingDatabase) to the design of [agent communication languages](UsingFIPAACL). It is by no means exhaustive, and will progressively be extended with more "recipes" in the future, depending on the concrete questions asked by users.
