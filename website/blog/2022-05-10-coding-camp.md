From the 4th to the 9th of May 2022 the Gama team held a Coding camp gathering Gama enthusiasts in Tam Cốc at [Chez Loan](https://lejournaldeloan.com) to work on the next Gama release and on future models.

The main focus was on getting a last round of development to finish Gama 1.8.2, that will be released in the coming days, together with a brand new website and a clean documentation. More than that, we already started important discussions about the architecture of Gama 2.0 and its development cycle.
We also had workshops around a future model supporting a serious game about the waste management system in Bắc Hưng Hải irrigation system. The model provides visual support to spatialize the players actions.

For those interested, you can already try the Release Candidate of Gama 1.8.2 [here](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/releases/tag/1.8.2-RC1)

Thanks to all the participants for your hard work and good spirits.
