  "description": "As soon as an experiment is launched, the modeler is facing a new environment (with different menus and views) called the Simulation Perspective). The Navigator is still available in this perspective (below the parameter view), though, and it is still possible to edit models in it, but it is considered as good practice to use each perspective for what it has been designed for: editing models in the Modeling perspective and running simulations in the Simulation perspective. Switching perspectives is easy. The small button in the top-left corner of the window allows to switch back and forth the two perspectives.",
