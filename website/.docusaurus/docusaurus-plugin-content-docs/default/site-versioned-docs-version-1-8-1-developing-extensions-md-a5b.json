  "description": "GAMA accepts extensions to the GAML language, defined by external programmers and dynamically loaded by the platform each time it is run. Extensions can represent new built-in species, types, file-types, skills, operators, statements, new control architectures or even types of displays. Other internal structures of GAML will be progressively \"opened\" to this mechanism in the future: display layers (hardwired for the moment), new types of outputs (hardwired for the moment), scheduling policies (hardwired for the moment), random number generators (hardwired for the moment).",
