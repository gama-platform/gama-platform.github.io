_Author : _

A model using a cellular automata to represent the Game of Life, the most famous example of cellular automata. Each cell will see if the number of living neighbours meets the condition to emerge or to live.


Code of the model : 

```
model life

//Declare the world as a torus or not torus environment
global torus: torus_environment {
	//Size of the environment
	int environment_width <- 200 min: 10 max: 1000;
	int environment_height <- 200 min: 10 max: 1000;
	
	//Declare as torus or not
	bool torus_environment <- true;
	//Density 
	int density <- 25 min: 1 max: 99;
	//Conditions to live
	list<int> living_conditions <- [2, 3];
	//Conditions to birth
	list<int> birth_conditions <- [3];
	//Color for living cells
	rgb livingcolor <- °white;
	//Color for dying cells
	rgb dyingcolor <- °red;
	//Color for emerging cells
	rgb emergingcolor <- °orange;
	//Color for dead cells
	rgb deadcolor <- °black;
	//Shape of the environment
	geometry shape <- rectangle(environment_width, environment_height);
	
	//Initialization of the model by writing the description of the model in the console
	init {
		do description;
	}
	
	//Ask at each life_cell to evolve and update
	reflex generation {
		ask life_cell {
			do evolve;
		}

		ask life_cell {
			do update;
		}

	}
	//Write the description of the model in the console
	action description {
		write
		'Description. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is the best-known example of a cellular automaton. The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input from humans. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.  The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are directly horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur: \\n\\t 1.Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation. \\n\\t 2.Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding. \\n\\t 3.Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation. \\n\\t 4.Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell. The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first(generation) is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed�births and deaths happen simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the one before). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.';
