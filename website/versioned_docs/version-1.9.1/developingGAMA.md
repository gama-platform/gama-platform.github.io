GAMA is written in Java and made of tens of Eclipse plugins and projects, thousand of classes, methods and annotations. This section of the wiki should help you have a general idea on how to manipulate GAMA Java API and where to find the proper classes and methods. A general introduction to the [GAMA architecture](GamaArchitecture) gives a general overview of the organization of Java packages and Eclipse plugins, and should be read first. In the following sub-sections we give a more practical introduction.
