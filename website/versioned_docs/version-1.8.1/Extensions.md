Here's the community list of existing extensions. Feel free to add yours.

If you want to add your extension, please follow this structure : 
- A title (the name of your extension)
- A short description (explain what your extension could be used for)
- An image (optional)
- A link (to your website, a download page or whatever relevant link)

Thanks!
