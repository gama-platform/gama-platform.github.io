# Manipulate basic species

In this chapter, we will learn how to manipulate some basic species. As you already know, a species can be seen as the definition of a type of **agent** (we call agent the instance of a species). In OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), a **species** can be seen as the class. Each species is then defined by some **attributes** ("member" in OOP), **actions** ("method" in OOP) and **behavior** ("method" in OOP).

In this section, we will first learn how to declare the **world agent**, using the [**global species**](GlobalSpecies). We will then learn how to declare [**regular species**](RegularSpecies) which will populate our world. The following lesson will be dedicated to learn how to [**define actions and behaviors**](DefiningActionsAndBehaviors) for all those species. We will then learn how [**agents can interact between each other**](InteractionBetweenAgents), especially with the statement `ask`. In the next chapter then, we will see how to [**attach skills**](AttachingSkills) to our species, giving them new attributes and actions. This section will be closed with a last lesson dealing with how [**inheritence**](Inheritance) works in GAML.
