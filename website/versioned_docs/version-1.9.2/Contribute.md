GAMA is a free opensource software and we take pride in sharing the source code with anyone who wants to contribute to the platform. Note that GAMA is easy to extend by developing additional plugins.

You saw an error on the website and you want to correct it. The first thing is to check which page should be updated !

## Editing `wiki`

Let's start by taking a look at the URL. For example :

```
https://gama-platform.org/wiki/Home
                          ^^^^
```

If in the URL you have the keyword `wiki`, you should modify the _GAMA wiki_ and the correction will appear in the website after the next build done by Travis CI.

To keep the same example, the file to edit will be here :

```
https://gama-platform.org/wiki/Home
                          ^^^^ ^^^^
=FILE-TO-EDIT=> https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/wiki/Home
                                                      ^^^^ ^^^^
```

## For Developers

### Source Code

GAMA can be downloaded as a regular application or [built from source](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama), which is necessary, if you want to contribute to the platform.
The source code is available from this GitHub repository:

```
https://github.com/gama-platform/gama
```

Which you can also browse from the web [here](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama).
It is, in any case, recommended to follow the instructions on [this page](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/wiki/InstallingGitVersion) in order to build GAMA from source.

### Sharing models

You can find models shared by the community in the [experimental repository](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama.models.experimental). From there you can just download the zip file of the repository, decompress it and import the models you want to try.

If you want to share your model to the community you can simply click on the `add file` button on the main page and upload the directory containing your gama project.
