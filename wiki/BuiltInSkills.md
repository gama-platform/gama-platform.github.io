## Introduction

Skills are built-in modules, written in Java, that provide a set of related built-in variables and built-in actions (in addition to those already provided by GAMA) to the species that declare them. A declaration of skill is done by filling the skills attribute in the species definition:

```
species my_species skills: [skill1, skill2] {
    ...
}
```

Skills have been designed to be mutually compatible so that any combination of them will result in a functional species. An example of skill is the `moving` skill.
  
So, for instance, if a species is declared as:

```
species foo skills: [moving]{
...
}
```

Its agents will automatically be provided with the following variables : `speed`, `heading`, `destination` and the following actions: `move`, `goto`, `wander`, `follow` in addition to those built-in in species and declared by the modeller. Most of these variables, except the ones marked read-only, can be customized and modified like normal variables by the modeller. For instance, one could want to set a maximum for the speed; this would be done by redeclaring it like this:

```
float speed max:100 min:0;
```

Or, to obtain a speed increasing at each simulation step:

```
float speed max:100 min:0  <- 1 update: speed * 1.01;
```

Or, to change the speed in a behavior:

```
if speed = 5 {
    speed <- 10;
}
```
