**GAMA** is a simulation platform, which aims at providing field experts, modellers, and computer scientists with a complete modelling and simulation development environment for building spatially explicit multi-agent simulations. It has been first developed by the Vietnamese-French research team MSI (located at IFI, Hanoi, and part of the IRD/UPMC International Research Unit UMMISCO) from 2007 to 2010, and is now developed by a consortium of academic and industrial partners led by UMMISCO, among which the University of Rouen, France, the University of Toulouse 1, France, the University of Orsay, France, the University of Can Tho, Vietnam, the National University of Hanoi, EDF R&D, France, and CEA LISC, France.

Some of the features of GAMA are illustrated in the videos above (more can be found [in our Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWJ1kWGDDI-9u2f2uD0gcaQ)).

Beyond these features, GAMA also offers:

* A complete modeling language, GAML, for modeling agents and environments
* A large and extensible library of primitives (agent's movement, communication, mathematical functions, graphical features, ...)
* A cross-platform reproducibility of experiments and simulations
* A powerful declarative drawing and plotting subsystem
* A flexible user interface based on the Eclipse platform
* A complete set of batch tools, allowing for a systematic or "intelligent" exploration of models parameters spaces


## Documentation
The documentation of GAMA is available online on the wiki of the project. It is organized around a few central activities ([installing GAMA](Installation), [writing models](WritingModels), [running experiments](LaunchingExperiments), [developing new extensions to the platform](DevelopingExtensions)) and provides complete references on both the [GAML language](GamlLanguage), the [platform](Platform) itself, and the scientific aspects of our work (with a complete [bibliography](References)). Several [tutorials](Tutorials) are also provided in the documentation in order to minimize the learning curve, allowing users to build, step by step, the models corresponding to these tutorials, which are of course shipped with the platform.

The documentation can be accessed from the side bar of this page. A good starting point for new users is [the installation page](Installation).

A standalone version of the documentation, in PDF format, can be directly downloaded from [here](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/wiki/Content/ressources/pdf/GAMA 1.6.1 Documentation.pdf)


## Source Code
GAMA can be [downloaded](Download) as a regular application or [built from source](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama), which is necessary if you want to contribute to the platform.
The source code is available from this GITHub repository:

```
https://github.com/gama-platform/gama
```

Which you can also browse from the web [here](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama).
It is, in any case, recommended to follow the instructions on [this page](InstallingGitVersion) in order to build GAMA from source.

## Contact Us
The best way to get in touch with the developers of GAMA is to sign in for the [gama-platform@googlegroups.com mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/gama-platform). If you wish to contribute to the platform, you might want, instead or in addition, to sign in for the [gama-dev@googlegroups.com mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/gama-dev). On both lists, we generally answer quite quickly to requests.

Finally, if you think you have found a bug in GAMA, or if you absolutely need a feature that does not exist yet, it is much more efficient and time-saving for everyone (including current and future users) to create a new issue report. Please refer to [these instructions](Troubleshooting#Submitting_an_Issue) to do so.
