We are thrilled  to announce the release of version 1.0.1 of [COMOKIT](https://comokit.org), as well as its official archiving on the [COMSES website](https://www.comses.net/codebases/7d686bf0-ff0a-46c0-b4a6-d341ef9e13c2/releases/1.0.1/).

COMOKIT, the COVID-19 modeling kit built on GAMA, is a computer model that allows in silico exploration of intervention policies before their implementation phase. It can take into account important dimensions of policy actions, such as the heterogeneity of individual responses or the spatial aspect of containment strategies. 

COMOKIT 1.0.1 is a bugfix version that makes it easier to create case studiees. It comes pre-bundled with sample datasets, which you can adapt to your case studies. Others are also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/COMOKIT/COMOKIT-Datasets).
