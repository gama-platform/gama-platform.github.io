We are very happy to introduce **GAMA Blog** !

<!--truncate-->

We created the GAMA Blog for the following reasons:

- To have a known place for you to be updated about GAMA news
- To have a place where we can communicate with all of you about :
  - Future release
  - Future project
  - Future GAMA events
- To simplify (for us) how we update you about everything : 
  - We will make a blog post here
  - The blog's RSS Feed is automatically updated
  - The article is share automatically on our [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/GamaPlatform)
  - The article is share automatically on our [Twitter account](https://www.twitter.com/gamaplatform)
  - You'll find the information on one of these way ! ðŸ˜ƒ
- And, finally, to start some conversation under every blog post (with the Facebook chat).

We sincerely hope that you'll all loved this Blog. We will do our best to keep it up-to-date with everything and a big thanks to all of you to support the GAMA project by using our software.
