As soon as an experiment is [launched](LaunchingExperiments), the modeler is facing a new environment (with different menus and views) called the _Simulation Perspective_). The _Navigator_ is still available in this perspective (below the parameter view), though, and it is still possible to [edit models](EditingModels) in it, but it is considered as good practice to use each perspective for what it has been designed for: editing models in the **Modeling perspective** and running simulations in the **Simulation perspective**. Switching perspectives is easy. The small button in the top-left corner of the window allows to switch back and forth the two perspectives.

The actual contents of the simulation perspective will depend on the experiment being run and the [outputs it defines](DefiningDisplaysGeneralities). The next sections will present the most common ones ([inspectors, monitors](InspectorsAndMonitors) and [displays](Displays)), as well as the views that are not defined in outputs, like the [Parameters](ParametersView) or [Errors view](ErrorsView). An overview of the [menus and commands](MenusAndCommands) specific to the simulation perspective is also available.
