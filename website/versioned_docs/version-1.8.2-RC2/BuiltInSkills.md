## Introduction

Skills are built-in modules, written in Java, that provide a set of related built-in variables and built-in actions (in addition to those already provided by GAMA) to the species that declare them. A declaration of skill is done by filling the skills attribute in the species definition:

```
species my_species skills: [skill1, skill2] {
    ...
}
```

Skills have been designed to be mutually compatible so that any combination of them will result in a functional species. An example of skill is the `moving` skill.
  
So, for instance, if a species is declared as:

```
species foo skills: [moving]{
...
}
```

Its agents will automatically be provided with the following variables : `speed`, `heading`, `destination` and the following actions: `move`, `goto`, `wander`, `follow` in addition to those built-in in species and declared by the modeller. Most of these variables, except the ones marked read-only, can be customized and modified like normal variables by the modeller. For instance, one could want to set a maximum for the speed; this would be done by redeclaring it like this:

```
float speed max:100 min:0;
```

Or, to obtain a speed increasing at each simulation step:

```
float speed max:100 min:0  <- 1 update: speed * 1.01;
```

Or, to change the speed in a behavior:

```
if speed = 5 {
    speed <- 10;
}
```

### Actions
	  
	 
#### **`contact_added_with`**

**This action can be redefined in order for the agent to implement a specific behavior when it comes into contact (collision) with another agent. It is automatically called by the physics simulation engine on both colliding agents. The default built-in behavior does nothing.**


**Returned type:** `unknown`

##### Additional facets: 
  	 			
* **`other`** (agent): represents the other agent with which a collision has been detected  
	 
#### **`contact_removed_with`**

**This action can be redefined in order for the agent to implement a specific behavior when a previous contact with another agent is removed. It is automatically called by the physics simulation engine on both colliding agents. The default built-in behavior does nothing.**


**Returned type:** `unknown`

##### Additional facets: 
  	 			
* **`other`** (agent): represents the other agent with which a collision has been detected  
	 
#### **`update_body`**

**This action must be called when the geometry of the agent changes in the simulation world and this change must be propagated to the physical world. The change of location (in either worlds) or the rotation due to physical forces do not count as changes, as they are already taken into account. However, a rotation in the simulation world need to be handled by calling this action. As it involves long operations (removing the agent from the physical world, then reinserting it with its new shape), this action should not be called too often.**


**Returned type:** `unknown`
