The SwITCh project aims at supporting decision-making for urban planning by simulating the gradual introduction of disruptive innovations on technology, usage and behaviour of infrastructure. It requires providing a model that is able to assess the impact of these innovations on several key indicators on mobility, user satisfaction and security, economic costs and air pollution. SwITCh integrates a large variety of urban transport modalities (private car, walk, tramway, etc.) and associated infrastructures (pavement, bicycle path, etc.). It uses agent- based modelling (ABM) and participatory simulation as a unifying framework that allows coupling different models and taking into account both temporal and spatial scales in order to build a holistic model. The resulting interactive simulator and serious game will be used by the city planners to explore the potential impact of innovations in various contexts, test and assess different alternatives and situations in two case studies: Bordeaux Metropole and the Urban Community of Dijon.

However, as the pandemic progresses, there is an urgent need for tools and methodologies to quickly analyze the effectiveness of responses against COVID-19 in different communities and contexts. In this perspective, computer modelling appears to be an invaluable lever as it allows for the in silico exploration of a range of intervention strategies prior to the potential field implementation phase. More specifically, we argue that, in order to take into account important dimensions of policy actions, such as the heterogeneity of the individual response or the spatial aspect of containment strategies, the branch of computer modeling known as agent-based modelling is of immense interest. We present in this paper an agent-based modelling framework called COVID-19 Modelling Kit (COMOKIT), designed to be generic, scalable, and thus portable in a variety of social and geographical contexts. COMOKIT combines models of person-to-person and environmental transmission, a model of individual epidemiological status evolution, an agenda-based one-hour time step model of human mobility, and an intervention model.

In most cases, however, a road closure is likely to deport traffic to nearby neighborhoods with the consequences of intensifying congestion and, possibly, increasing air pollution in these areas. Because this outcome might appear counter-intuitive to most stakeholders, it is becoming more and more necessary to analyze, assess, and share the impacts of these developments in terms of traffic and pollution shifts before implementing them. In the HoanKiemAir project, we used the GAMA platform to build an agent-based model that simulates the traffic, its emissions of air pollutants, and the diffusion of these pollutants in the district of Hoan Kiem. This simulation has been designed so as to serve either as a decision support tool for local authorities or as an awareness-raising tool for the general public: thanks to its display on a physical 3D model of the district, people can effectively and very naturally interact with it at public venues.

Diverse questions related to sustainability are rise from this growth. For example, for large and attractive territories, which urban planning policies to implement? How to manage and prevent technological or environmental hazards? Decision-makers have to take all of these issues into account when defining their urban planning policies. Unfortunately, the assessment of the impacts of possible policies is difficult due to the complex and stochastic interplay between society and infrastructure. One of the most promising approaches to face this difficulty is agent-based modeling. This approach consists in modeling the studied system as a collection of interacting decision-making entities called agents. An agent-based model can provide relevant information about the dynamics of the real-world urban system it represents. Moreover, it can allow them to be used as a virtual laboratory to test new urban planning policies. The use of agent-based models to study urban systems is booming for the last ten years. Another tendency is the development of more and more realist models. However, if models have to make a lot of progress concerning the integration of geographical and statistical data, the agents used to represent the different actors influencing the dynamic of the system (inhabitants, decision-makers...) are often simplistic (reactive agents). Yet, for some urban models, being able to integrate these cognitive agents, i.e. agents able to make complex reasoning such as planning to achieve their goals, is mandatory to improve the realism of models and test new scenarios. Unfortunately, developing large-scale models that integrate cognitive agents requires high-level programming skills. Indeed, if there are nowadays several software platforms that propose to help modelers to define their agent-based models through a dedicated modeling language (Netlogo, GAMA...) or through a graphical interface (Starlogo TNG, Modelling4All, Repast Symphony, MAG\xe9o...), none of them are adapted to the development of such models by modelers with low-level programming skills: either they are too complex to use (Repast, GAMA) or too limited (Netlogo, Starlogo TNG, Modelling4All, Repast Symphony, MAG\xe9o). As a result, geographers and urban planners that have no programming skills have to rely on computer scientists to develop models, which slows the development and the use of complex and realist spatial agent-based models. The objective of the ACTEUR project is to develop to help modelers, in particular geographers and urban planners, to design and calibrate through a graphical language cognitive agents able to act in a complex spatial environment. The platform has also for ambition to be used as a support of model discussion -participatory modeling- between the different actors concerned by a model (geographers, sociologists, urban planners, decision-makers, representatives...). These tools will be integrated into the GAMA platform that enables us to build large-scale models with thousands of hundreds of agents and that was already used to develop models with cognitive agents. In order to illustrate the utility and the importance of the developed tools, we will use them in two case studies. The first concerns the urban evolution of La R\xe9union island. The second case study will focus on the adaption to industrial hazards in Rouen.
