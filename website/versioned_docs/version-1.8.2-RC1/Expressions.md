Expressions in GAML are the value part of the [statements](Statements)' facets. They represent or compute data that will be used as the value of the facet when the statement will be executed.

An expression can be either a [literal](Literals), a [unit](UnitsAndConstants), a [constant](UnitsAndConstants), a [variable](PseudoVariables), an [attribute](VariablesAndAttributes) or the application of one or several [operators](Exhaustive-list-of-GAMA-Keywords) to compose a complex expression.
