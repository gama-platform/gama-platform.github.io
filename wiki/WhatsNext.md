  * [!images/general/icon_default_navigation.png](!images/general/icon_default_navigation.png) The **classic navigation** : to have a classic top-down navigation.
  * [!images/general/icon_learning_graph_navigation.png](!images/general/icon_learning_graph_navigation.png) The **learning path navigation** : select the concept you want to learn, and a learning path will be build just for you, in order to assimilate this concept more quickly !
  * [!images/general/icon_search_navigation.png](!images/general/icon_search_navigation.png) The **search related navigation** : for each page, some suggestions of related pages (dealing with the same concepts, or presenting the same GAML world) allows you to have a more transversal navigation.
