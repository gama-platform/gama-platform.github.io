  "description": "Unless you are using the version of GAMA built from the sources available in the GIT repository of the project (see here), you are normally running a specific release of GAMA that sports a given version number (e.g. GAMA 1.8.1, GAMA 1.7, GAMA 1.6.1, etc.). When new features were developed, or when serious issues were fixed, the release you had on your disk, prior to GAMA 1.6.1, could not benefit from them. Since the version 1.6.1, however, GAMA has been enhanced to support a self\\update_ mechanism, which allows you to import from the GAMA update site additional plugins (offering new features) or updated versions of the plugins that constitute the core of GAMA.",
