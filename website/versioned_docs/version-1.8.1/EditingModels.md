Editing models in GAMA is very similar to editing programs in a modern IDE like [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org). After having successfully [launched](Launching) the program, the user has two fundamental concepts at its disposal: a **workspace**, which contains models or links to models organized like a hierarchy of files in a filesystem, and the **workbench** (aka, the _main window_), which contains the tools to create, modify and experiment these models.

Understanding how to navigate in the **workspace** is covered in [another section](NavigatingWorkspace) and, for the purpose of this section, we just need to understand that it is organized in **projects**, which contain **models** and their associated data. **Projects** are further categorized, in GAMA, into four categories: _Models Library_, _Plugin models_, _Test models_ (built-in models shipped with GAMA and automatically linked from the workspace), and _User Models_.

This section covers the following sub-sections:

1. [GAML Editor Generalities](GamlEditorGeneralities)
2. [GAML Editor Toolbar](GamlEditorToolbar)
3. [Validation of Models](ValidationOfModels)
4. [Graphical Editor](G__GraphicalEditor)
