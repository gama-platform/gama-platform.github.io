# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

[//]: # (concept|video)
## Can we record a video from an experiment ?

No, we cannot directly. But you have two alternatives :
- With the set of images generated with the `autosave` facet of an experiment, you can construct your own video file using powerful software such as [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/).
- You can directly record the video stream using software such as [VLC Media Player](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) or [QuickTime](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/).
