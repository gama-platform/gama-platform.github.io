# Introduction

During the [PDI2012](http://www.ummisco.ird.fr/pdi/) nearly 50 PhD students were working together on different topic related to complex system modeling.
At the end of the formation, each student (by groups of 2 or 3) had to present a model in a mini-projet. The purpose of this mii-project was to use a platform and to create a model related to their respective research topics. Here is an overview of the model that has been implemented with Gama. Some of those projects has been presenting in [COMMISCO 2012](http://www.ummisco.ird.fr/pdi/spip.php?rubrique6)


# Projects

## First year (promo2012)
**Siny  Ndoye - Quang Truong Chi** _Modelisation of the land use applied to the commune of My An-Ben Tre in the Delta Mekong._

Since 1999, Vietnam has transformed 380 000 ha of rice agriculture into aquaculture. It has different impact like the fall of the rice agriculture, forest destruction and demographic increase near aqua farm. The shrimp culture is responsible of the destruction of the mangrove swamp since the 90's. The aim of this model was to study the impact of a government aid for rice producer on this problem.

**Cedrigue Djiongo - Abdelkarim Ed-Darraz** _Modelisation of the different  land use in the forest._

The model study the dynamic of forest parcel over the time according to the activity of nomad paysans. The parcel can have different state such as primary forest, chromolaena forest, bush fallow, forest crop field or secondary forest).

**Souleymane Sy - Nghi Huynh Quang** _Impact of the dynamic of the vegetation of the rain in west africa_

West africa is one of the part of the world that faced the most climate variability during the second half of the 20th century. To understand the origin on the variability on the amount of rain Gama is used to study the impact of the vegetation dynamic on the rain using a retroactivity between vegetation and atmosphere

**Hédia Zardi - Tran Thi Cam Giang** _Modelisation of the SEIR model by GAMA_

Until today, many infectious diseases in the world such as measles, tuberculosis, dengue ... still exist. These diseases are one of the main causes of infant mortality in most countries of Asis, Africa, etc.
Therefore, we want to present these infectious diseases in the computer models, after we want to find the periods of diseases to provide positive solutions that allow us to turn them off.

## Second year (promo2011)

**Ahmed Tidjane Cisse - Arnaud Grignard** _Vector disease modélisation- Multi point of view approach and visualization._

Propose a meta-model applied to vector disease. Gama has been used to study the rift valley fever disease according to a meta-model previously defined. The idea is to define basic or macro behavior for host, environment and  infectious agent on which a vector is moving and then to implement those meta-agent for a specific vector disease (in this case the rift valey fever).

## Third year (promo2010)

**Moussa Gueye - Inès Hassoumi - Zineb Belarbi** _Impact of the dispersion of air pollutants: applied to the city of Tunis_

This project study the impact of pollutants on the environment on the health. The goal is to identify where new urban zone can be created by taking in account the concentration of each pollutants in the city. The main interest of the model is the coupling of the data coming from numerical equation of the advection-diffusion process using finite element method and then include those results on a grid created in Gama on which the value of each pollutants is extrapolated.
