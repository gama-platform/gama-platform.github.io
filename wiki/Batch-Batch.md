#  Model using Batch mode


_Author :  Patrick Taillandier_

A model showing how to use batch experiments to find the best combination of parameters to minimize the numbers of infected people in a SIR infection model where agents infect others and become immune for a certain time. The batch mode uses three different methods : Exhaustive, GA and Tabu Search. The model proposes five experiments : one simple with a User Interface, one running 5 experiments and saving the data, and one for each strategy. 


Code of the model : 

```

    int number_people <- 300;  // The init number of people
    int number_I <- 1 ;	// The init number of infected
    float infection_rate <- 0.1 ; // The infection rate
	float infection_distance <- 5.0 ; // infection distance (in meters)
	int immune_step <- 30 ; // number of steps before becoming immune after infection
	int end_immunity_step <-50; // number of steps before not being immune anymore
	float speed_people <- 5.0 ; // speed of the Host

	int nb_infected <- 0;
	init {
		create people number: number_people ;
        ask (number_I among people) {
