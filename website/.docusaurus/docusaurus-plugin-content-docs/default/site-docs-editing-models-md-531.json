  "description": "Editing models in GAMA is very similar to editing programs in a modern IDE like Eclipse. After having successfully launched the program, the user has two fundamental concepts at its disposal: a workspace, which contains models or links to models organized like a hierarchy of files in a filesystem, and the workbench (aka, the main window), which contains the tools to create, modify and experiment these models.",
