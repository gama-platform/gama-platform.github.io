#  Movement of an agent on different paths


_Author : _

Model showing the movement of an agent following three different paths : one defined by its vertices, an other defined thanks to all the roads species, and finally a path defined by a graph with weights (graph created thanks to an other species)


Code of the model : 

```
model path_and_follow

global{
	graph the_graph;
    init{
    		//It is possible to define a road by defining its shape, being a line. The line need to be created by passing the location of the vertices
       create road {
       		shape <- line([{0,50},{40,60}]);
       }
       create road {
       		shape <- line([{40,60},{50,50},{55,60}]);
       }
       create road {
       		shape <- line([{55,60},{65,40}]);
       }
       
       create road_of_graph {
       		shape <- line([{65,40},{75,35}]);
       }
       create road_of_graph {
       		shape <- line([{75,35},{85,40},{80,60}]);
       }
       //It is possible to define a weights map by linking the road and their weights (the road will be the key of the weight)
       map<road_of_graph,float> weight_map <- road_of_graph as_map (each::each.shape.perimeter * 10);
       
       //A graph can be defined by using a list or all the agents of a species and it is possible to use a map of weights with each key 
       // of the map being a road to link the road and its weight
       //The as_edge_graph operator is an operator creating a graph using the list of agents passed as edges of the graph
