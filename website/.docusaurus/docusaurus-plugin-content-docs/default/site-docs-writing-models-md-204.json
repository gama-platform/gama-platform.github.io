  "description": "Models in GAMA play the same role as classes in Java or C++: they represent both the knowledge about a particular phenomenon a user wants to simulate and the way(s) to simulate it. A model is nothing more than a text file (or a collection of text files that refer to each other), which contains instructions in a specific language called GAML (for \"GAMA Modeling Language\").",
