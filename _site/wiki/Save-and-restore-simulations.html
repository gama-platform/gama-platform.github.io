<p>Last version of GAMA has introduced new features to save the state of a simulation at a given simulation cycle. This has two main applications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The possibility to step forward and backward in a simulation,</li>
  <li>The possibility to save the state of a simulation in a file and to restore a simulation from this file.</li>
</ul>
