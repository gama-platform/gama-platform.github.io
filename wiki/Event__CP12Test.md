# Test Models & Language

  * A Coding Dojo (5 people) was organized in order to sensibilize developpers about unit tests.
The produced code is available here: https://github.com/SergeStinckwich/TennisKataTamCoc
The usual retrospective done after a Dojo is here: https://github.com/SergeStinckwich/TennisKataTamCoc/tree/master/README

  * Some very simple models has been done in the "multi-scale" group with An. At that occasion, we didn't define real tests, but the idea was the same: define models as simple as possible that illustrate some basic concepts. The same work should be done for all aspects (skills, operators, actions, GAML architecture, ...).

  * Difficult and boring to introduce tests in the GAMA platform at the moment. It is easier to introduce tests in ongoing developments. For example, Serge and Samuel do some unit tests for the new GraphSkill based on GraphStream.
