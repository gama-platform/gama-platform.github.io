How to teach using GAMA itself? What kind of pedagogical material should be available? How to share this material? Share training experiences? \n* GAMA Missing features: what are the most important features missing in GAMA? Extensions that should be developed urgently? Capabilities overlooked for too many years? Integrations with other tools missing? \n* Next generation GAMA: how should a platform like GAMA evolve in the next 10 years? Which roadmaps should we define? Which technological advances, necessary for users, should be embraced? \n\nCo-organized by MIAT (INRAE), IRIT (CNRS, INPT, Toulouse universities) and UMMISCO (IRD) laboratories, the event will be held from June 23 to 25, 2021. Due to the covid-19 pandemics and in order to allow the participation of as many people as possible, the GAMA days will take place online and registration will be free.\n\n\n**Official Website:** https://www.irit.fr/GamaDays2021/\n\n**Steering committee:**\n* Frédéric Amblard - *UT1, UMR IRIT*\n* Kevin Chapuis - *IRD, UMI UMMISCO*\n* Alexis Drogoul - *IRD, UMI UMMISCO*\n* Benoit Gaudou - *UT1/IRD, UMR IRIT/UMI UMMISCO*\n* Dominique Longin - *CNRS, UMR IRIT*\n* Nicolas Verstaevel - *UT1, UMR IRIT*\n\n\n**Organizer:** \n* Patrick Taillandier - *INRAE, MIAT*\n\n**Program committee:**\n* Carole Adam - *UGA, LIG Laboratory*\n* Diana F.

Our aim is to keep the Dockerfile content as simple as possible in order to help the widest possible audience to understand and use this.\n\n## Why Docker?\n\n* Docker provides a robust platform for Continuous Delivery, Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, facilitating delivery of innovation faster.\n* Facilitates customers packaging their configured systems into images and containers\n* Facilitates easy portability to virtual machines or bare metal servers, on-premise or in the cloud (IaaS)\n* Docker provides a transparent mechanism that facilitates collaboration with the open-source community, facilitating rapid convergence on best practices for DevOps (build, functional/PSR test, demo, deploy).\n\n## What for\n\nThis container aim to help the usage of the GAMA headless to everyone. Thanks to that container, you'll be able to easily deploy a container on  \n\n[![Github gama.docker](https://i.imgur.com/bCXNqmJ.png)](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama.docker)\n\n## Roadmap\n\nEven if the container is already usable, this image Docker is still under an heavy developpement and you should use it wisely. Our goal in a near future are :\n\n* To reduce it's size. The container packed the whole GAMA software, but the headless do not use it all, so we have to cut every useless part for the headless\n* Have a fully working CI based on the [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/gama-platform/) releases\n* Improve the usability of the container. For now a lot of mistakes have been made about the input/output of the container\n\n## Try it!\n\nEven if it's not perfectly finished, we already published our Dockerfiles on [Github](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama.docker) and the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/gamaplatform/gama). Go take a look if you're interested.\n\nWe would love to hear about your experiences with the GAMA Platform on Docker so we can continue to improve it.\n\nEnjoy!"

Nevertheless, its use requires significant computer programming work because it requires describing all agents and their behavior in the form of algorithms. The GAMA open-source platform aims to help modelers do this work. <!--truncate--> This generic platform, which has been developed since 2007 by a consortium of research teams allows the content of a model to be built using a modeling language that is easy to access and simulated. GAMA has experienced significant growth in recent years thanks to its ability to build and simulate large-scale models, including hundreds of thousands of agents and detailed geographic data. It also has advanced 3D visualization tools as well as tools dedicated to the construction of serious games. This platform is now used in many research projects dealing with issues as varied as epidemiology, land-use change, natural or technological risks, natural resource management, and urban mobility.\n\nHowever, while many training courses on this platform are organized around the world every year, no event has ever had the ambition to bring users and developers together in the same place. This is precisely the objective of the GAMA days, which will be held **from 10 to 12 June in Toulouse (France)**. The challenge is to encourage exchanges between participants: to allow platform (or plug-in) developers to present their latest creations and to allow users to show how they use the platform. These exchanges will be an important step towards a better structuring of the GAMA community. \n\nIn practical terms, these days will be composed of 3 types of sessions: \n* presentation of new functionalities and exchanges with users on existing functionalities \n* presentation of new models or projects that are based on, or include, GAMA,\n* tutorials on specific features, extensions or applications of GAMA \n\n**Official Website:** https://www.irit.fr/GamaDays2020/\n\n**Steering committee:**\n* Frédéric Amblard - *UT1, UMR IRIT*\n* Kevin Chapuis - *IRD, UMI UMMISCO*\n* Alexis Drogoul - *IRD, UMI UMMISCO*\n* Benoit Gaudou - *UT1/IRD, UMR IRIT/UMI UMMISCO*\n* Dominique Longin - *CNRS, UMR IRIT*\n* Nicolas Verstaevel - *UT1, UMR IRIT*\n\n\n**Organizer:** \n* Patrick Taillandier - *INRA, MIAT*\n\n**Program committee:**\n* Carole Adam - *UGA, LIG Laboratory*\n* Diana F.
