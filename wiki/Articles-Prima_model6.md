This model shows how to create agent and make them move randomly in the world.Some agents are infected, and others can gain the infection if they are in a certain range. The people are now placed in buildings at the initial state. Those buildings are created thanks toa shapefile. Roads are also created thanks to an other shapefile. A graph is now created fromthe road agents, and the people move from their location to a targent on the graph. The displayis now a 3D display. The model adds a new level as people going inside a building will be nowa new species belonging to the building and that will be manage by the building agent concernedThe people_in_building agent will be infected inside a building respecting an ordinary differentialequation system.


Code of the model :
