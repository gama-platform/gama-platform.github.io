Once again it was held in Tam Cốc at <a href="https://lejournaldeloan.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chez Loan</a> from the 11th to the 16th of April.</p><p>This year the goal was to finalize the release of GAMA 1.9.1 and start working on GAMA 2.
Even if the weather was a bit demoralizing this year, everyone did their best and the resulting GAMA 1.9.1 is probably the most polished version of GAMA to be released.</p><p>You can already download GAMA 1.9.1 <a href="https://gama-platform.org/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p><p>Thanks to all the people that made their way to Tam Cốc as well as the ones that participated in remote, it was a real pleasure, and see you next year!</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Collage" src="/assets/images/coding_camp_collage_2023-68a3c0b91814175ab8ddeab4aac50ed8.jpeg" width="2048" height="2048" class="img_ev3q"></p>]]></content:encoded>

More than that, we already started important discussions about the architecture of Gama 2.0 and its development cycle.
We also had workshops around a future model supporting a serious game about the waste management system in Bắc Hưng Hải irrigation system. The model provides visual support to spatialize the players actions.</p><p>For those interested, you can already try the Release Candidate of Gama 1.8.2 <a href="https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/releases/tag/1.8.2-RC1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p><p>Thanks to all the participants for your hard work and good spirits.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Besides models themselves, which will constitute the main focus of the conference, we also seek original contributions on three transversal themes, from the point of view of users:</p><ul><li>GAMA and training: how to teach modeling and simulation using GAMA? How to teach using GAMA itself? What kind of pedagogical material should be available? How to share this material? Share training experiences? </li><li>GAMA Missing features: what are the most important features missing in GAMA? Extensions that should be developed urgently? Capabilities overlooked for too many years? Integrations with other tools missing? </li><li>Next generation GAMA: how should a platform like GAMA evolve in the next 10 years? Which roadmaps should we define? Which technological advances, necessary for users, should be embraced? </li></ul><p>Co-organized by MIAT (INRAE), IRIT (CNRS, INPT, Toulouse universities) and UMMISCO (IRD) laboratories, the event will be held from June 23 to 25, 2021. Due to the covid-19 pandemics and in order to allow the participation of as many people as possible, the GAMA days will take place online and registration will be free.</p><p><strong>Official Website:</strong> <a href="https://www.irit.fr/GamaDays2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.irit.fr/GamaDays2021/</a></p><p><strong>Steering committee:</strong></p><ul><li>Frédéric Amblard - <em>UT1, UMR IRIT</em></li><li>Kevin Chapuis - <em>IRD, UMI UMMISCO</em></li><li>Alexis Drogoul - <em>IRD, UMI UMMISCO</em></li><li>Benoit Gaudou - <em>UT1/IRD, UMR IRIT/UMI UMMISCO</em></li><li>Dominique Longin - <em>CNRS, UMR IRIT</em></li><li>Nicolas Verstaevel - <em>UT1, UMR IRIT</em></li></ul><p><strong>Organizer:</strong> </p><ul><li>Patrick Taillandier - <em>INRAE, MIAT</em></li></ul><p><strong>Program committee:</strong></p><ul><li>Carole Adam - <em>UGA, LIG Laboratory</em></li><li>Diana F.

It can take into account important dimensions of policy actions, such as the heterogeneity of individual responses or the spatial aspect of containment strategies. </p><p>COMOKIT 1.0.1 is a bugfix version that makes it easier to create case studiees. It comes pre-bundled with sample datasets, which you can adapt to your case studies. Others are also available on <a href="https://github.com/COMOKIT/COMOKIT-Datasets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="City" src="/assets/images/cities_gama-71a9449a5dc30e8e81dd29a232ee4fa2.png" width="709" height="530" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Agent-based modeling is nowadays becoming increasingly popular for the study of complex systems. Nevertheless, its use requires significant computer programming work because it requires describing all agents and their behavior in the form of algorithms. The GAMA open-source platform aims to help modelers do this work. <!-- --> This generic platform, which has been developed since 2007 by a consortium of research teams allows the content of a model to be built using a modeling language that is easy to access and simulated. GAMA has experienced significant growth in recent years thanks to its ability to build and simulate large-scale models, including hundreds of thousands of agents and detailed geographic data. It also has advanced 3D visualization tools as well as tools dedicated to the construction of serious games. This platform is now used in many research projects dealing with issues as varied as epidemiology, land-use change, natural or technological risks, natural resource management, and urban mobility.</p><p>However, while many training courses on this platform are organized around the world every year, no event has ever had the ambition to bring users and developers together in the same place. This is precisely the objective of the GAMA days, which will be held <strong>from 10 to 12 June in Toulouse (France)</strong>. The challenge is to encourage exchanges between participants: to allow platform (or plug-in) developers to present their latest creations and to allow users to show how they use the platform. These exchanges will be an important step towards a better structuring of the GAMA community. </p><p>In practical terms, these days will be composed of 3 types of sessions: </p><ul><li>presentation of new functionalities and exchanges with users on existing functionalities </li><li>presentation of new models or projects that are based on, or include, GAMA,</li><li>tutorials on specific features, extensions or applications of GAMA </li></ul><p><strong>Official Website:</strong> <a href="https://www.irit.fr/GamaDays2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.irit.fr/GamaDays2020/</a></p><p><strong>Steering committee:</strong></p><ul><li>Frédéric Amblard - <em>UT1, UMR IRIT</em></li><li>Kevin Chapuis - <em>IRD, UMI UMMISCO</em></li><li>Alexis Drogoul - <em>IRD, UMI UMMISCO</em></li><li>Benoit Gaudou - <em>UT1/IRD, UMR IRIT/UMI UMMISCO</em></li><li>Dominique Longin - <em>CNRS, UMR IRIT</em></li><li>Nicolas Verstaevel - <em>UT1, UMR IRIT</em></li></ul><p><strong>Organizer:</strong> </p><ul><li>Patrick Taillandier - <em>INRA, MIAT</em></li></ul><p><strong>Program committee:</strong></p><ul><li>Carole Adam - <em>UGA, LIG Laboratory</em></li><li>Diana F.
