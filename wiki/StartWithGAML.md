In this part, we will present you some basic concepts of GAML that will help you a lot for the next pages. 

You will first learn how to [**organize a standard model**](ModelOrganization), then you will learn about some [**basis about GAML**](BasicProgrammingConceptsInGAML), such as how to declare a variable, how to use the basic operators, how to write a conditional structure or a loop, how to manipulate containers and how to generate random values.
