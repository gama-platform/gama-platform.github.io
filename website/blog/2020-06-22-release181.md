We are pleased to release version 1.8.1 of the GAMA modelling and simulation platform. It is mainly a bug fix release, with a few minor enhancements. See the [changelog here](https://gama-platform.github.io/release) (or on [GitHub here](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)). 

All the models running on 1.8 should work without changes on 1.8.1. As usual, make a backup of your files before upgrading and report any issues here.
