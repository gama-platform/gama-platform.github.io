  "description": "As described in the presentation of GAML, the hierarchy of species derives from a single built-in species called agent. All its components (attributes, actions) will then be inherited by all direct or indirect children species (including model and experiment), with the exception of species that explicitly mention useminimalagents: true as a facet, which inherit from a stripped-down version of agent (see below).",
