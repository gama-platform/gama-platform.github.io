# Defining monitors and inspectors

Other outputs can be very useful to study better the behavior of your agents.

## Define a monitor

[//]: # (keyword|statement_monitor)
A [monitor](InspectorsAndMonitors#monitor) allows to follow the value of an arbitrary expression in GAML. It will appear, in the User Interface, in a small window on its own and be recomputed every time step (or according to its refresh facet). 

Definition of a monitor: 

```
monitor monitor_name value: an_expression refresh:boolean_statement;
```

with:
* `value:` mandatory, the expression whose value will be displayed by the monitor.
* `refresh:` bool statement, optional : the new value is computed if the bool statement returns true.

Example:

```
experiment my_experiment type: gui {
	output {
		monitor monitor_name value: cycle refresh:every(1);
	}
}
```

NB : you can also declare monitors during the simulation, by clicking on the button "Add new monitor", and specifying the name of the variable you want to follow.

## Define an inspector

[//]: # (keyword|statement_inspector)
During the simulation, the user interface of GAMA provides the user the possibility to [inspect an agent](InspectorsAndMonitors), or a group of agents. But you can also define the inspector you want directly from your model, as an output of the experiment.

Use the statement `inspect` to define your inspector, in the output scope of your gui experiment. The inspector has to be named (using the facet `name`), a value has to be specified (with the `value` facet).

```
inspect name:"inspector_name" value:the_value_you_want_to_display;
```

Note that you can inspect any type of species (regular species, grid species, even the world...).

The optional facet `type` is used to specify the type of your inspector. 2 values are possible : 
* _agent_ (default value) if you want to display the information as a regular [agent inspector](InspectorsAndMonitors#agent-inspector). Note that if you want to inspect a large number of agents, this can take a lot of time. In this case, prefer the other type _table_
* _table_ if you want to display the information as an [agent browser](InspectorsAndMonitors#agent-browser)

The optional facet `attribute` is used to filter the attributes you want to be displayed in your inspector.

**Beware** : only one agent inspector (`type:agent`) can be used for an experiment. Beside, you can add as many agent browser (`type:table`) as you want for your experiment.

Example of implementation :

```
model new

global {
	init {
		create my_species number:3;
	}
}

species my_species {
	int int_attr <- 6;
	string str_attr <- "my_value";
	string str_attr_not_important <- "blabla";
}

grid my_grid_species width: 10 height: 10 {
	int rnd_value <- rnd(5);
}

experiment my_experiment type:gui {
	output {
		inspect name:"my_species_inspector" value:my_species attributes:["int_attr","str_attr"];
		inspect name:"my_species_browser" value:my_species type:table;
		inspect name:"my_grid_species_browser" value:5 among my_grid_species type:table;
	}
}
```

Another statement, `browse`, is doing a similar thing, but preferring the _table_ type (if you want to browse an agent species, the default type will be the _table_ type).
