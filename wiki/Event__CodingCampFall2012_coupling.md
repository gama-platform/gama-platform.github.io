# Coupling GAMA with hydrodynamics simulators

# Integration of EDP solver into GAMA

The maps.gaml.extensions has been extended in order to allow modeler to write its own equation systems (as simple strings), specify parameters with their values and variables and "solve"/integrate them either step by step or N steps by N steps.

An example has been implemented on the Lokta-Voltera equation system.

Possible extension:
  * parse the equations to detect errors
  * rename the skill has EDO, because we consider only variables depending on time
  * extends to solve EDP
  * add some methods/algorithms in order to "resolve" the system, in a sense of finding some equilibria (asymptots or oscillation equilibrium...)


# R in GAMA
**Results**: Verifying the old operators (A simple example "CallingR" is uploaded in the model list); Applying these statistical operators on the data loaded from RDBMS.

# SQL features in GAMA
Results:
  * 1.Added PostgresSQL driver into SQSKILL and AgentDB.
  * 2.Wrote example models for testing.
  * Now,GAMA supported query features for MySQL, MSSQL, PostgresSQL and SQLite.

# Physics engine

Integration of a 3D Physics Engine Library (http://jbullet.advel.cz/) in `simtools.gaml.extensions.physics`
This has been implemented as a new skill.
