# Defining advanced species

In the previous chapter, we saw how to declare and manipulate [**regular species**](RegularSpecies) and the [**global species**](GlobalSpecies) (as a reminder, the instance of the **global species** is the **world agent**). 

We will now see that GAMA provides you the possibility to declare some special species, such as [**grids**](GridSpecies) or [**graphs**](GraphSpecies), with their own built-in attributes and their own built-in actions. We will also see how to declare [**mirror species**](MirrorSpecies), which is a "copy" of a regular species, in order to give it an other representation. Finally, we will learn how to represent several agents through one unique agent, with [**multi-level architecture**](MultiLevelArchitecture).
