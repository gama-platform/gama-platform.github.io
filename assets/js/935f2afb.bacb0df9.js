When new features were developed, or when serious issues were fixed, the release you had on your disk, prior to GAMA 1.6.1, could not benefit from them. Since the version 1.6.1, however, GAMA has been enhanced to support a self\\\\update_ mechanism, which allows you to import from the GAMA update site additional plugins (offering new features) or updated versions of the plugins that constitute the core of GAMA.","sidebar":"side"},"Using_Git":{"id":"Using_Git","title":"Using Git from GAMA to version and share models","description":"Install the Git client [Tested on the GAMA 1.9.0]","sidebar":"side"},"Using-BEN-simple-bdi":{"id":"Using-BEN-simple-bdi","title":"Using BEN (simple_bdi)","description":"[//]: # (keyword|concept_bdi)","sidebar":"side"},"Using-extensions":{"id":"Using-extensions","title":"Using extensions","description":"The core GAMA software can be extended with some additional plugins, allowing the model to give more capabilities to agents (negotiation, using fuzzy logic, or Bayesian network) or providing connections to external softwares such as R or Matlab.","sidebar":"side"},"UsingDatabase":{"id":"UsingDatabase","title":"Using Database Access","description":"Database features of GAMA provide a set of actions on Database Management Systems (DBMS).

To these purposes, the modeler can define a set of assertions that will be tested. Before the execution of the embedded set of instructions, if a setup is defined in the species, model or experiment, it is executed. In a test, if one assertion fails, the evaluation of other assertions continue.","sidebar":"side"},"WritingModels":{"id":"WritingModels","title":"Writing Models","description":"Models in GAMA play the same role as classes in Java or C++: they represent both the knowledge about a particular phenomenon a user wants to simulate and the way(s) to simulate it.
