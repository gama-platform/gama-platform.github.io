# Get Started in 5 Minutes

1. First, run script as detailled in the previous README to have the full wiki ready

2. Make sure all the dependencies for the website are installed:

```sh
# Install dependencies
$ npm
```
3. Run your dev server:

```sh
# Start the site
$ npm start
```

## Directory Structure

Your project file structure should look something like this

```

# Editing Content


You saw an error on the website and you want to correct it. The first thing is to check which page should be updated !

## Editing website parameters

The website have a big config file. This file is fully documented and will configure many things from the website (logo, title, etc etc etc). 

You can find it here : _\<project>/website/siteConfig.js_

## Editing `wiki`

Let's start by taking a look at the URL. For example :

```
https://gama-platform.github.io/wiki/Home
                                ^^^^
```

If in the URL you have the keyword `wiki`, you should modify the _GAMA wiki_ and the correction will appear in the website after the next build done by Travis CI.

To keep the same example, the file to edit will be here :

```
https://gama-platform.github.io/wiki/Home
                                ^^^^ ^^^^
=FILE-TO-EDIT=> https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/wiki/Home
                                                      ^^^^ ^^^^
```

## Editing site specific pages

If you don't have the `wiki` keyword, the page you want to edit is probably a React page (like the *download* page or the *index* page).

This pages are located in _\<project>/website/pages/_ and you'll need to have some basics in React to edit pages.

# Adding Content

## Adding items to the wiki's sidebar

The wiki is generated from the [_GAMA wiki_](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/wiki). So if you want to add an item in site's wiki, you should add it in the _GAMA_'s wiki.

## Adding items to the site's sidebar

The sidebar is generated from the [_GAMA wiki_](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/wiki). So if you want to add an item in site's sidebar, you should add it in the _GAMA wiki_'s sidebar.

## Adding items to the site's top navigation bar

1. Add links to docs, custom pages or external links by editing the headerLinks field of `website/siteConfig.js`:

`website/siteConfig.js`
```javascript
{
  headerLinks: [
    ...
    /* you can add docs */
    { doc: 'my-examples', label: 'Examples' },
    /* you can add custom pages */
    { page: 'help', label: 'Help' },
    /* you can add external links */
    { href: 'https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus', label: 'GitHub' },
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
```

## Adding custom pages

1. Docusaurus uses React components to build pages. The components are saved as .js files in `website/pages/en`:
1. If you want your page to show up in your navigation header, you will need to update `website/siteConfig.js` to add to the `headerLinks` element:

`website/siteConfig.js`
```javascript
{
  headerLinks: [
    ...
    { page: 'my-new-custom-page', label: 'My New Custom Page' },
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
```
