Do Not Edit It.    Definition  Operators in the GAML language are used to compose complex expressions. An operator performs a function on one, two, or n operands (which are other expressions and thus may be themselves composed of operators) and returns the result of this function.  Most of them use a classical prefixed functional syntax (i.e. operator_name(operand1, operand2, operand3), see below), with the exception of arithmetic (e.g. +, /), logical (and, or), comparison (e.g. >, <), access (., ..) and pair (::) operators, which require an infixed notation (i.e. operand1 operator_symbol operand1).  The ternary functional if-else operator, ? :, uses a special infixed syntax composed with two symbols (e.g. operand1 ? operand2 : operand3). Two unary operators (- and !) use a traditional prefixed syntax that does not require parentheses unless the operand is itself a complex expression (e.g.   - 10, ! (operand1 or operand2) ).  Finally, special constructor operators ({...} for constructing points, ... for constructing lists and maps) will require their operands to be placed between their two symbols (e.g. {1,2,3}, operand1, operand2, ..., operandn or key1::value1, key2::value2... keyn::valuen).  With the exception of these special cases above, the following rules apply to the syntax of operators: * if they only have one operand, the functional prefixed syntax is mandatory (e.g. operator_name(operand1)) * if they have two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. operator_name(operand1, operand2)) or the infixed syntax (e.g. operand1 operator_name operand2) can be used. * if they have more than two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. operator_name(operand1, operand2, ..., operand)) or a special infixed syntax with the first operand on the left-hand side of the operator name (e.g. operand1 operator_name(operand2, ..., operand)) can be used.  All of these alternative syntaxes are completely equivalent.  Operators in GAML are purely functional, i.e. they are guaranteed to not have any side effects on their operands. For instance, the shuffle operator, which randomizes the positions of elements in a list, does not modify its list operand but returns a new shuffled list.    Priority between operators  The priority of operators determines, in the case of complex expressions composed of several operators, which one(s) will be evaluated first.  GAML follows in general the traditional priorities attributed to arithmetic, boolean, comparison operators, with some twists. Namely: * the constructor operators, like ::, used to compose pairs of operands, have the lowest priority of all operators (e.g. a > b :: b > c will return a pair of boolean values, which means that the two comparisons are evaluated before the operator applies. Similarly, a > 10, b > 5 will return a list of boolean values. * it is followed by the ?: operator, the functional if-else (e.g.   a > b ? a + 10 : a - 10 will return the result of the if-else). * next are the logical operators, and and or (e.g. a > b or b > c will return the value of the test) * next are the comparison operators (i.e. >, <, <=, >=, =, !=) * next the arithmetic operators in their logical order (multiplicative operators have a higher priority than additive operators) * next the unary operators - and ! * next the access operators . and  (e.g. {1,2,3}.x > 20 + {4,5,6}.y  will return the result of the comparison between the x and y ordinates of the two points) * and finally the functional operators, which have the highest priority of all.    Using actions as operators  Actions defined in species can be used as operators, provided they are called on the correct agent. The syntax is that of normal functional operators, but the agent that will perform the action must be added as the first operand.  For instance, if the following species is defined:   species spec1 {  int min(int x, int y) {       return x > y ? x : y;  } }   Any agent instance of spec1 can use min as an operator (if the action conflicts with an existing operator, a warning will be emitted). For instance, in the same model, the following line is perfectly acceptable:   global {  init {       create spec1;       spec1 my_agent <- spec10;       int the_min <- my_agent min(10,20); // or min(my_agent, 10, 20);  } }   If the action doesn t have any operands, the syntax to use is my_agent the_action(). Finally, if it does not return a value, it might still be used but is considering as returning a value of type unknown (e.g. unknown result <- my_agent the_action(op1, op2);).  Note that due to the fact that actions are written by modelers, the general functional contract is not respected in that case: actions might perfectly have side effects on their operands (including the agent).

Better to use  until  or  before  in that case every(2#days) after (starting_date + 1#day)  // the computation will return true every two days (using the starting_date of the model as the starting point) only for the dates strictly after this starting_date + 1#day         ### agent  Possible use:    agent (any) —>  agent   Result: Casts the operand into the type agent    ### agent_closest_to  Possible use:    agent_closest_to (unknown) —>  agent   Result: An agent, the closest to the operand (casted as a geometry).

The principle of the ELECTRE methods is to compare the possible candidates by pair. These methods analyses the possible outranking relation existing between two candidates. An candidate outranks another if this one is at least as good as the other one. The ELECTRE methods are based on two concepts: the concordance and the discordance. The concordance characterizes the fact that, for an outranking relation to be validated, a sufficient majority of criteria should be in favor of this assertion. The discordance characterizes the fact that, for an outranking relation to be validated, none of the criteria in the minority should oppose too strongly this assertion. These two conditions must be true for validating the outranking assertion.

In: Figueira, J., Greco, S., and Ehrgott, M., (Eds.), Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis: State of the Art Surveys, Springer, New York, 133–162 (2005). The first operand is the list of candidates (a candidate is a list of criterion values); the second operand the list of criterion: A criterion is a map that contains fives elements: a name, a weight, a preference value (p), an indifference value (q) and a veto value (v). The preference value represents the threshold from which the difference between two criterion values allows to prefer one vector of values over another. The indifference value represents the threshold from which the difference between two criterion values is considered significant. The veto value represents the threshold from which the difference between two criterion values disqualifies the candidate that obtained the smaller value; the last operand is the fuzzy cut.  Special cases:    returns -1 is the list of candidates is nil or empty   Examples:      int var0 <- electre_DM(1.0, 7.0,4.0,2.0,3.0, 3.0,  name :: utility ,  weight  :: 2.0, p ::0.5,  q ::0.0,  s ::1.0,  maximize  :: true, name :: price ,  weight  :: 1.0, p ::0.5,  q ::0.0,  s ::1.0,  maximize  :: false,0.7); // var0 equals 0       See also:  weighted_means_DM, promethee_DM, evidence_theory_DM,    ### ellipse  Possible use:    float ellipse float —>  geometry   ellipse (float , float) —>  geometry   Result: An ellipse geometry which x-radius is equal to the first operand and y-radius is equal to the second operand  Comment: the center of the ellipse is by default the location of the current agent in which has been called this operator.  Special cases:    returns a point if both operands are lower or equal to 0, a line if only one is.   Examples:      geometry var0 <- ellipse(10, 10); // var0 equals a geometry as an ellipse of width 10 and height 10.

Comment: the empty operator behavior depends on the nature of the operand  Special cases:    if it is a map, empty returns true if the map contains no key-value mappings, and false otherwise   if it is a file, empty returns true if the content of the file (that is also a container) is empty, and false otherwise   if it is a population, empty returns true if there is no agent in the population, and false otherwise   if it is a graph, empty returns true if it contains no vertex and no edge, and false otherwise   if it is a matrix of int, float or object, it will return true if all elements are respectively 0, 0.0 or null, and false otherwise   if it is a matrix of geometry, it will return true if the matrix contains no cell, and false otherwise   if it is a list, empty returns true if there is no element in the list, and false otherwise        bool var0 <- empty(); // var0 equals true         if it is a string, empty returns true if the string does not contain any character, and false otherwise        bool var1 <- empty ( abced ); // var1 equals false        ### enlarged_by    Same signification as +    ### envelope  Possible use:    envelope (unknown) —>  geometry   Result: A 3D geometry that represents the box that surrounds the geometries or the surface described by the arguments.

Will return true every time the current_date matches with this frequency Retrieves elements from the first argument every step (second argument) elements. Raises an error if the step is negative or equal to zero true every operand * cycle, false otherwise  Comment: Used to do something at regular intervals of time. Can be used in conjunction with  since ,  after ,  before ,  until  or  between , so that this computation only takes place in the temporal segment defined by these operators. In all cases, the starting_date of the model is used as a reference starting pointthe value of the every operator depends on the cycle. It can be used to do something every x cycle.  Examples:     (date( 2000-01-01 ) to date( 2010-01-01 )) every (#month) // builds an interval between these two dates which contains all the monthly dates starting from the beginning of the interval reflex when: every(2#days) since date( 2000-01-01 ) { .. } state a { transition to: b when: every(2#mn);} state b { transition to: a when: every(30#s);} // This oscillatory behavior will use the starting_date of the model as its starting point in time if every(2#cycle) {write  the cycle number is even ;}       else {write  the cycle number is odd ;}       See also:  to, since, after,    ### every_cycle    Same signification as every    ### evidence_theory_DM  Possible use:    msi.gama.util.IList<java.util.List> evidence_theory_DM msi.gama.util.IList<java.util.Map<java.lang.String,java.lang.Object>> —>  int   evidence_theory_DM (msi.gama.util.IList<java.util.List> , msi.gama.util.IList<java.util.Map<java.lang.String,java.lang.Object>>) —>  int   evidence_theory_DM (msi.gama.util.IList<java.util.List>, msi.gama.util.IList<java.util.Map<java.lang.String,java.lang.Object>>, bool) —>  int   Result: The index of the best candidate according to a method based on the Evidence theory. This theory, which was proposed by Shafer (http://www.glennshafer.com/books/amte.html Shafer G (1976) A mathematical theory of evidence, Princeton University Press), is based on the work of Dempster (http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&version=1.0&verb=Display&handle=euclid.aoms/1177698950 Dempster A (1967) Upper and lower probabilities induced by multivalued mapping.

If this int parameter is equal to 0, the data is considered as already projected. opens a file that a is a kind of OSM file with some filtering.  Comment: The file should have a OSM file extension, cf. file type definition for supported file extensions.The file should have a OSM file extension, cf. file type definition for supported file extensions.  Special cases:    If the specified string does not refer to an existing OSM file, an exception is risen.   If the specified string does not refer to an existing OSM file, an exception is risen.

See also:  rotated_by, translated_by,    ### translated_by  Possible use:    geometry translated_by point —>  geometry   translated_by (geometry , point) —>  geometry   Result: A geometry resulting from the application of a translation by the right-hand operand distance to the left-hand operand (geometry, agent, point)  Examples:      geometry var0 <- self translated_by {10,10,10}; // var0 equals the geometry resulting from applying the translation to the left-hand geometry (or agent).       See also:  rotated_by, transformed_by,    ### translated_to    Same signification as at_location    ### transpose  Possible use:    transpose (matrix) —>  matrix   Result: The transposition of the given matrix  Examples:      matrix var0 <- transpose(matrix(5,-3,6,-4)); // var0 equals matrix(5,6,-3,-4)         ### triangle  Possible use:    triangle (float) —>  geometry   Result: A triangle geometry which side size is given by the operand.  Comment: the center of the triangle is by default the location of the current agent in which has been called this operator.  Special cases:    returns nil if the operand is nil.   Examples:      geometry var0 <- triangle(5); // var0 equals a geometry as a triangle with side_size = 5.

Special cases:    when the operand is a point, it is read as {mean, standardDeviation}   if the operand is a list, only the two first elements are taken into account as mean, standardDeviation   when truncated_gauss is called with a list of only one element mean, it will always return 0.0   Examples:      float var0 <- truncated_gauss ({0, 0.3}); // var0 equals a float between -0.3 and 0.3  float var1 <- truncated_gauss (0.5, 0.0); // var1 equals 0.5       See also:  gauss,    ### type_of  Possible use:    type_of (unknown) —>  msi.gaml.types.IType<?>     ### undirected  Possible use:    undirected (graph) —>  graph   Result: the operand graph becomes an undirected graph.  Comment: the operator alters the operand graph, it does not create a new one.  See also:  directed,    ### union  Possible use:    union (container<geometry>) —>  geometry   container union container —>  list   union (container , container) —>  list   Result: returns a new list containing all the elements of both containers without duplicated elements.  Special cases:    if the left or right operand is nil, union throws an error   if the right-operand is a container of points, geometries or agents, returns the geometry resulting from the union all the geometries   Examples:      list var0 <- 1,2,3,4,5,6 union 2,4,9; // var0 equals 1,2,3,4,5,6,9  list var1 <- 1,2,3,4,5,6 union 0,8; // var1 equals 1,2,3,4,5,6,0,8  list var2 <- 1,3,2,4,5,6,8,5,6 union 0,8; // var2 equals 1,3,2,4,5,6,8,0  geometry var3 <- union(geom1, geom2, geom3); // var3 equals a geometry corresponding to union between geom1, geom2 and geom3       See also:  inter, +,    ### unknown  Possible use:    unknown (any) —>  unknown   Result: Casts the operand into the type unknown    ### until  Possible use:    until (date) —>  bool   any expression until date —>  bool   until (any expression , date) —>  bool   Result: Returns true if the current_date of the model is before (or equel to) the date passed in argument. Synonym of  current_date <= argument   Examples:     reflex when: until(starting_date) {}  // This reflex will be run only once at the beginning of the simulation         ### upper_case  Possible use:    upper_case (string) —>  string   Result: Converts all of the characters in the string operand to upper case  Examples:      string var0 <- upper_case( Abc ); // var0 equals  ABC        See also:  lower_case,    ### URL_file  Possible use:    URL_file (string) —>  file   Result: Constructs a file of type URL.

Comment: the operator alters the operand graph, it does not create a new one.  See also:  path_between,    ### user_input  Possible use:    user_input (any expression) —>  map<string,unknown>   string user_input any expression —>  map<string,unknown>   user_input (string , any expression) —>  map<string,unknown>   Result: asks the user for some values (not defined as parameters). Takes a string (optional) and a map as arguments. The string is used to specify the message of the dialog box. The map is to specify the parameters you want the user to change before the simulation starts, with the name of the parameter in string key, and the default value as value.  Comment: This operator takes a map string::value as argument, displays a dialog asking the user for these values, and returns the same map with the modified values (if any). The dialog is modal and will interrupt the execution of the simulation until the user has either dismissed or accepted it. It can be used, for instance, in an init section to force the user to input new values instead of relying on the initial values of parameters :  Examples:     map<string,unknown> values2 <- user_input( Enter numer of agents and locations , Number  :: 100,  Location  :: {10, 10}); create bug number: int(values2 at  Number ) with: location:: (point(values2 at  Location )); map<string,unknown> values <- user_input( Number  :: 100,  Location  :: {10, 10}); create bug number: int(values at  Number ) with: location:: (point(values at  Location ));         ### using  Possible use:    any expression using topology —>  unknown   using (any expression , topology) —>  unknown   Result: Allows to specify in which topology a spatial computation should take place.  Special cases:    has no effect if the topology passed as a parameter is nil   Examples:      unknown var0 <- (agents closest_to self) using topology(world); // var0 equals the closest agent to self (the caller) in the continuous topology of the world         ### variance  Possible use:    variance (container) —>  float   Result: the variance of the elements of the operand. See Variance for more details.  Comment: The operator casts all the numerical element of the list into float. The elements that are not numerical are discarded.  Examples:      float var0 <- variance (4.5, 3.5, 5.5, 7.0); // var0 equals 1.671875       See also:  mean, median,    ### variance  Possible use:    variance (float) —>  float   variance (int, float, float) —>  float   Result: Returns the variance of a data sequence. That is (sumOfSquares - mean*sum) / size with mean = sum/size. Returns the variance from a standard deviation.    ### variance_of  Possible use:    container variance_of any expression —>  unknown   variance_of (container , any expression) —>  unknown   Result: the variance of the right-hand expression evaluated on each of the elements of the left-hand operand  Comment: in the right-hand operand, the keyword each can be used to represent, in turn, each of the right-hand operand elements.  See also:  min_of, max_of, sum_of, product_of,    ### vertical  Possible use:    vertical (msi.gama.util.GamaMap<java.lang.Object,java.lang.Integer>) —>  msi.gama.util.tree.GamaNode<java.lang.String>     ### voronoi  Possible use:    voronoi (list<point>) —>  list<geometry>   list<point> voronoi geometry —>  list<geometry>   voronoi (list<point> , geometry) —>  list<geometry>   Result: A list of geometries corresponding to the Voronoi diagram built from the list of points according to the given clip A list of geometries corresponding to the Voronoi diagram built from the list of points  Examples:      list var0 <- voronoi({10,10},{50,50},{90,90},{10,90},{90,10}, square(300)); // var0 equals the list of geometries corresponding to the Voronoi Diagram built from the list of points with a square of 300m side size as clip.  list var1 <- voronoi({10,10},{50,50},{90,90},{10,90},{90,10}); // var1 equals the list of geometries corresponding to the Voronoi Diagram built from the list of points.         ### weight_of  Possible use:    graph weight_of unknown —>  float   weight_of (graph , unknown) —>  float   Result: returns the weight of the given edge (right-hand operand) contained in the graph given in right-hand operand.  Comment: In a localized graph, an edge has a weight by default (the distance between both vertices).  Special cases:    if the left-operand (the graph) is nil, returns nil   if the right-hand operand is not an edge of the given graph, weight_of checks whether it is a node of the graph and tries to return its weight   if the right-hand operand is neither a node, nor an edge, returns 1.   Examples:     graph graphFromMap <-  as_edge_graph({1,5}::{12,45},{12,45}::{34,56}); float var1 <- graphFromMap weight_of(link({1,5},{12,45})); // var1 equals 1.0         ### weighted_means_DM  Possible use:    msi.gama.util.IList<java.util.List> weighted_means_DM msi.gama.util.IList<java.util.Map<java.lang.String,java.lang.Object>> —>  int   weighted_means_DM (msi.gama.util.IList<java.util.List> , msi.gama.util.IList<java.util.Map<java.lang.String,java.lang.Object>>) —>  int   Result: The index of the candidate that maximizes the weighted mean of its criterion values. The first operand is the list of candidates (a candidate is a list of criterion values); the second operand the list of criterion (list of map)  Special cases:    returns -1 is the list of candidates is nil or empty   Examples:      int var0 <- weighted_means_DM(1.0, 7.0,4.0,2.0,3.0, 3.0,  name :: utility ,  weight  :: 2.0, name :: price ,  weight  :: 1.0); // var0 equals 1       See also:  promethee_DM, electre_DM, evidence_theory_DM,    ### where  Possible use:    container where any expression —>  list   where (container , any expression) —>  list   Result: a list containing all the elements of the left-hand operand that make the right-hand operand evaluate to true.  Comment: in the right-hand operand, the keyword each can be used to represent, in turn, each of the right-hand operand elements.  Special cases:    if the left-hand operand is a list nil, where returns a new empty list   if the left-operand is a map, the keyword each will contain each value        list var4 <- 1::2, 3::4, 5::6 where (each >= 4); // var4 equals 4, 6      Examples:      list var0 <- 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 where (each > 3); // var0 equals 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 list var2 <- g2 where (length(g2 out_edges_of each) = 0 ); // var2 equals node9, node7, node10, node8, node11  list var3 <- (list(node) where (round(node(each).location.x) > 32); // var3 equals node2, node3       See also:  first_with, last_with, where,    ### with_lifetime  Possible use:    predicate with_lifetime int —>  predicate   with_lifetime (predicate , int) —>  predicate   Result: change the parameters of the given predicate  Examples:     predicate with_lifetime 10         ### with_max_of  Possible use:    container with_max_of any expression —>  unknown   with_max_of (container , any expression) —>  unknown   Result: one of elements of the left-hand operand that maximizes the value of the right-hand operand  Comment: in the right-hand operand, the keyword each can be used to represent, in turn, each of the right-hand operand elements.  Special cases:    if the left-hand operand is nil, with_max_of returns the default value of the right-hand operand   Examples:      unknown var0 <- 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 with_max_of (each ); // var0 equals 8  unknown var2 <- g2 with_max_of (length(g2 out_edges_of each)  ) ; // var2 equals node4  unknown var3 <- (list(node) with_max_of (round(node(each).location.x)); // var3 equals node3  unknown var4 <- 1::2, 3::4, 5::6 with_max_of (each); // var4 equals 6       See also:  where, with_min_of,    ### with_min_of  Possible use:    container with_min_of any expression —>  unknown   with_min_of (container , any expression) —>  unknown   Result: one of elements of the left-hand operand that minimizes the value of the right-hand operand  Comment: in the right-hand operand, the keyword each can be used to represent, in turn, each of the right-hand operand elements.  Special cases:    if the left-hand operand is nil, with_max_of returns the default value of the right-hand operand   Examples:      unknown var0 <- 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 with_min_of (each ); // var0 equals 1  unknown var2 <- g2 with_min_of (length(g2 out_edges_of each)  ); // var2 equals node11  unknown var3 <- (list(node) with_min_of (round(node(each).location.x)); // var3 equals node0  unknown var4 <- 1::2, 3::4, 5::6 with_min_of (each); // var4 equals 2       See also:  where, with_max_of,    ### with_optimizer_type  Possible use:    graph with_optimizer_type string —>  graph   with_optimizer_type (graph , string) —>  graph   Result: changes the shortest path computation method of the given graph  Comment: the right-hand operand can be  Djikstra ,  Bellmann ,  Astar  to use the associated algorithm. Note that these methods are dynamic: the path is computed when needed. In contrarily, if the operand is another string, a static method will be used, i.e. all the shortest are previously computed.  Examples:     graphEpidemio <- graphEpidemio with_optimizer_type  static ;       See also:  set_verbose,    ### with_precision  Possible use:    float with_precision int —>  float   with_precision (float , int) —>  float   point with_precision int —>  point   with_precision (point , int) —>  point   geometry with_precision int —>  geometry   with_precision (geometry , int) —>  geometry   Result: Rounds off the value of left-hand operand to the precision given by the value of right-hand operand Rounds off the ordinates of the left-hand point to the precision given by the value of right-hand operand A geometry corresponding to the rounding of points of the operand considering a given precison.

See also:  round,    ### with_values  Possible use:    predicate with_values map —>  predicate   with_values (predicate , map) —>  predicate   Result: change the parameters of the given predicate  Examples:     predicate with_values  time ::10         ### with_weights  Possible use:    graph with_weights list —>  graph   with_weights (graph , list) —>  graph   graph with_weights map —>  graph   with_weights (graph , map) —>  graph   Result: returns the graph (left-hand operand) with weight given in the map (right-hand operand).  Comment: this operand re-initializes the path finder  Special cases:    if the right-hand operand is a list, affects the n elements of the list to the n first edges. Note that the ordering of edges may change overtime, which can create some problems…   if the left-hand operand is a map, the map should contains pairs such as: vertex/edge::double    graph_from_edges (list(ant) as_map each::one_of (list(ant))) with_weights (list(ant) as_map each::each.food)      ### without_holes  Possible use:    without_holes (geometry) —>  geometry   Result: A geometry corresponding to the operand geometry (geometry, agent, point) without its holes  Examples:      geometry var0 <- solid(self); // var0 equals the geometry corresponding to the geometry of the agent applying the operator without its holes.         ### writable  Possible use:    file writable bool —>  file   writable (file , bool) —>  file   Result: Marks the file as read-only or not, depending on the second boolean argument, and returns the first argument  Comment: A file is created using its native flags. This operator can change them. Beware that this change is system-wide (and not only restrained to GAMA): changing a file to read-only mode (e.g.  writable(f, false) )  Examples:      file var0 <- shape_file( ../images/point_eau.shp ) writable false; // var0 equals returns a file in read-only mode       See also:  file,    ### xml_file  Possible use:    xml_file (string) —>  file   Result: Constructs a file of type xml. Allowed extensions are limited to xml    ### xor  Possible use:    bool xor bool —>  bool   xor (bool , bool) —>  bool   Result: a bool value, equal to the logical xor between the left-hand operand and the right-hand operand.

See also:  or, and, !,    ### years_between  Possible use:    date years_between date —>  int   years_between (date , date) —>  int   Result: Provide the exact number of years between two dates. This number can be positive or negative (if the second operand is smaller than the first one)  Examples:      int var0 <- years_between(date( 2000-01-01 ), date( 2010-01-01 )); // var0 equals 10       ","url":"wiki/Operators.md"},{"id":"wiki/VariablesAndAttributes.md","title":" Variables and Attributes","content":"Variables and Attributes  Variables and attributes represent named data that can be used in an expression. They can be accessed depending on their scope:   * the scope of attributes declared in a species is itself, its child species and its micro-species.   * the scope of temporary variables is the one in which they have been declared, and all its sub-scopes. Outside its scope of validity, an expression cannot use a variable or an attribute directly. However, attributes can be used in a remote fashion by using a dotted notation on a given agent (see here).  Table of contents     Variables and Attributes  Direct Access       Remote Access Direct Access When an agent wants to use either one of the variables declared locally, one of the attributes declared in its species (or parent species), one of the attributes declared in the macro-species of its species, it can directly invoke its name and the compiler will do the rest (i.e. finding the variable or attribute in the right scope). For instance, we can have a look at the following example:      species animal {    float energy <- 1000 min: 0 max: 2000 update: energy - 0.001;    int age_in_years <- 1 update: age_in_years + int (time / 365);  action eat (float amount <- 0) { float gain <- amount / age_in_years; energy <- energy + gain;    }  reflex feed {       int food_found <- rnd(100);       do eat (amount: food_found);     }  }         Species declaration > Everywhere in the species declaration, we are able to directly name and use:  time, a global built-in variable,       energy and age_in_years, the two species attributes. > Nevertheless, in the species declaration, but outside of the action eat and the reflex feed, we cannot name the variables:       amount, the argument of eat action,       gain, a local variable defined into the eat action,       food_found, the local variable defined into the feed reflex. Eat action declaration > In the eat action declaration, we can directly name and use:  time, a global built-in variable,       energy and age_in_years, the two species attributes,       amount, which is an argument to the action eat,       gain, a temporary variable within the action. > We cannot name and use the variables:       food_found, the local variable defined into the feed reflex. feed reflex declaration > Similarly, in the feed reflex declaration, we can directly name and use:  time, a global built-in variable,       energy and age_in_years, the two species variables,       food_found, the local variable defined into the reflex. > But we cannot access to variables:       amount, the argument of eat action,       gain, a local variable defined into the eat action. Remote Access When an expression needs to get access to the attribute of an agent which does not belong to its scope of execution, a special notation (similar to that used in Java) has to be used:   remote_agent.variable   where remote_agent can be the name of an agent, an expression returning an agent, self, myself or each. For instance, if we modify the previous species by giving its agents the possibility to feed another agent found in its neighbourhood, the result would be:   species animal {    float energy <- 1000 min: 0 max: 2000 update: energy - 0.001;    int age_in_years <- 1 update: age_in_years + int (time / 365);    action eat (float amount <- 0.0) { float gain <- amount / age_in_years; energy <- energy + gain;    }    action feed (animal target){ if (agent_to_feed != nil) and (agent_to_feed.energy < energy { // verifies that the agent exists and that it need to be fed   ask agent_to_feed {       do eat amount: myself.energy / 10; // asks the agent to eat 10% of our own energy   }   energy <- energy - (energy / 10); // reduces the energy by 10% }    }    reflex { animal candidates <- agents_overlapping (10 around agent.shape); gathers all the neighbours agent_to_feed value: candidates with_min_of (each.energy); //grabs one agent with the lowest energy  do feed target: agent_to_feed; // tries to feed it    } }   In this example, agent_to_feed.energy, myself.energy and each.energy show different remote accesses to the attribute energy. The dotted notation used here can be employed in assignments as well. For instance, an action allowing two agents to exchange their energy could be defined as:   action random_exchange {//exchanges our energy with that of the closest agent      animal one_agent <- agent_closest_to (self)/>      float temp  <-one_agent.energy; // temporary storage of the agent s energy      one_agent.energy <- energy; // assignment of the agent s energy with our energy      energy <- temp; }  ","url":"wiki/VariablesAndAttributes.md"},{"id":"wiki/OperatorsSplitted.md","title":" Operators","content":"Operators    This file is automatically generated from java files.

Most of them use a classical prefixed functional syntax (i.e. operator_name(operand1, operand2, operand3), see below), with the exception of arithmetic (e.g. +, /), logical (and, or), comparison (e.g. >, <), access (., ..) and pair (::) operators, which require an infixed notation (i.e. operand1 operator_symbol operand1).  The ternary functional if-else operator, ? :, uses a special infixed syntax composed with two symbols (e.g. operand1 ? operand2 : operand3). Two unary operators (- and !) use a traditional prefixed syntax that does not require parentheses unless the operand is itself a complex expression (e.g.   - 10, ! (operand1 or operand2) ).  Finally, special constructor operators ({...} for constructing points, ... for constructing lists and maps) will require their operands to be placed between their two symbols (e.g. {1,2,3}, operand1, operand2, ..., operandn or key1::value1, key2::value2... keyn::valuen).  With the exception of these special cases above, the following rules apply to the syntax of operators: * if they only have one operand, the functional prefixed syntax is mandatory (e.g. operator_name(operand1)) * if they have two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. operator_name(operand1, operand2)) or the infixed syntax (e.g. operand1 operator_name operand2) can be used. * if they have more than two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. operator_name(operand1, operand2, ..., operand)) or a special infixed syntax with the first operand on the left-hand side of the operator name (e.g. operand1 operator_name(operand2, ..., operand)) can be used.  All of these alternative syntaxes are completely equivalent.  Operators in GAML are purely functional, i.e. they are guaranteed to not have any side effects on their operands. For instance, the shuffle operator, which randomizes the positions of elements in a list, does not modify its list operand but returns a new shuffled list.    Priority between operators  The priority of operators determines, in the case of complex expressions composed of several operators, which one(s) will be evaluated first.  GAML follows in general the traditional priorities attributed to arithmetic, boolean, comparison operators, with some twists. Namely: * the constructor operators, like ::, used to compose pairs of operands, have the lowest priority of all operators (e.g. a > b :: b > c will return a pair of boolean values, which means that the two comparisons are evaluated before the operator applies. Similarly, a > 10, b > 5 will return a list of boolean values. * it is followed by the ?: operator, the functional if-else (e.g.   a > b ? a + 10 : a - 10 will return the result of the if-else). * next are the logical operators, and and or (e.g. a > b or b > c will return the value of the test) * next are the comparison operators (i.e. >, <, <=, >=, =, !=) * next the arithmetic operators in their logical order (multiplicative operators have a higher priority than additive operators) * next the unary operators - and ! * next the access operators . and  (e.g. {1,2,3}.x > 20 + {4,5,6}.y  will return the result of the comparison between the x and y ordinates of the two points) * and finally the functional operators, which have the highest priority of all.    Using actions as operators  Actions defined in species can be used as operators, provided they are called on the correct agent. The syntax is that of normal functional operators, but the agent that will perform the action must be added as the first operand.  For instance, if the following species is defined:   species spec1 {  int min(int x, int y) {       return x > y ? x : y;  } }   Any agent instance of spec1 can use min as an operator (if the action conflicts with an existing operator, a warning will be emitted). For instance, in the same model, the following line is perfectly acceptable:   global {  init {       create spec1;       spec1 my_agent <- spec10;       int the_min <- my_agent min(10,20); // or min(my_agent, 10, 20);  } }   If the action doesn t have any operands, the syntax to use is my_agent the_action(). Finally, if it does not return a value, it might still be used but is considering as returning a value of type unknown (e.g. unknown result <- my_agent the_action(op1, op2);).  Note that due to the fact that actions are written by modelers, the general functional contract is not respected in that case: actions might perfectly have side effects on their operands (including the agent).

Returns the difference of the two operands.  Comment: The behavior of the operator depends on the type of the operands.

The principle of the ELECTRE methods is to compare the possible candidates by pair. These methods analyses the possible outranking relation existing between two candidates. An candidate outranks another if this one is at least as good as the other one. The ELECTRE methods are based on two concepts: the concordance and the discordance. The concordance characterizes the fact that, for an outranking relation to be validated, a sufficient majority of criteria should be in favor of this assertion. The discordance characterizes the fact that, for an outranking relation to be validated, none of the criteria in the minority should oppose too strongly this assertion. These two conditions must be true for validating the outranking assertion. More information about the ELECTRE methods can be found in http://www.springerlink.com/content/g367r44322876223/ Figueira,  J., Mousseau, V., Roy, B.: ELECTRE Methods. In: Figueira, J., Greco, S., and Ehrgott, M., (Eds.), Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis: State of the Art Surveys, Springer, New York, 133–162 (2005). The first operand is the list of candidates (a candidate is a list of criterion values); the second operand the list of criterion: A criterion is a map that contains fives elements: a name, a weight, a preference value (p), an indifference value (q) and a veto value (v). The preference value represents the threshold from which the difference between two criterion values allows to prefer one vector of values over another. The indifference value represents the threshold from which the difference between two criterion values is considered significant. The veto value represents the threshold from which the difference between two criterion values disqualifies the candidate that obtained the smaller value; the last operand is the fuzzy cut.  Special cases:    returns -1 is the list of candidates is nil or empty   Examples:      int var0 <- electre_DM(1.0, 7.0,4.0,2.0,3.0, 3.0,  name :: utility ,  weight  :: 2.0, p ::0.5,  q ::0.0,  s ::1.0,  maximize  :: true, name :: price ,  weight  :: 1.0, p ::0.5,  q ::0.0,  s ::1.0,  maximize  :: false,0.7); // var0 equals 0       See also:  weighted_means_DM, promethee_DM, evidence_theory_DM,    ### ellipse  Possible use:    float ellipse float —>  geometry   ellipse (float , float) —>  geometry   Result: An ellipse geometry which x-radius is equal to the first operand and y-radius is equal to the second operand  Comment: the center of the ellipse is by default the location of the current agent in which has been called this operator.  Special cases:    returns a point if both operands are lower or equal to 0, a line if only one is.   Examples:      geometry var0 <- ellipse(10, 10); // var0 equals a geometry as an ellipse of width 10 and height 10.

More general than geometry(arguments).envelope, as it allows to pass int, double, point, image files, shape files, asc files, or any list combining these arguments, in which case the envelope will be correctly expanded. If an envelope cannot be determined from the arguments, a default one of dimensions (0,100, 0, 100, 0, 100) is returned    ### eval_gaml  Possible use:    eval_gaml (string) —>  unknown   Result: evaluates the given GAML string.

Raises an error if the step is negative or equal to zero true every operand * cycle, false otherwise  Comment: Used to do something at regular intervals of time. Can be used in conjunction with  since ,  after ,  before ,  until  or  between , so that this computation only takes place in the temporal segment defined by these operators. In all cases, the starting_date of the model is used as a reference starting pointthe value of the every operator depends on the cycle. It can be used to do something every x cycle.  Examples:     (date( 2000-01-01 ) to date( 2010-01-01 )) every (#month) // builds an interval between these two dates which contains all the monthly dates starting from the beginning of the interval reflex when: every(2#days) since date( 2000-01-01 ) { .. } state a { transition to: b when: every(2#mn);} state b { transition to: a when: every(30#s);} // This oscillatory behavior will use the starting_date of the model as its starting point in time if every(2#cycle) {write  the cycle number is even ;}       else {write  the cycle number is odd ;}       See also:  to, since, after,    ### every_cycle    Same signification as every    ### evidence_theory_DM  Possible use:    msi.gama.util.IList<java.util.List> evidence_theory_DM msi.gama.util.IList<java.util.Map<java.lang.String,java.lang.Object>> —>  int   evidence_theory_DM (msi.gama.util.IList<java.util.List> , msi.gama.util.IList<java.util.Map<java.lang.String,java.lang.Object>>) —>  int   evidence_theory_DM (msi.gama.util.IList<java.util.List>, msi.gama.util.IList<java.util.Map<java.lang.String,java.lang.Object>>, bool) —>  int   Result: The index of the best candidate according to a method based on the Evidence theory. This theory, which was proposed by Shafer (http://www.glennshafer.com/books/amte.html Shafer G (1976) A mathematical theory of evidence, Princeton University Press), is based on the work of Dempster (http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&version=1.0&verb=Display&handle=euclid.aoms/1177698950 Dempster A (1967) Upper and lower probabilities induced by multivalued mapping. Annals of Mathematical Statistics, vol.  38, pp. 325–339) on lower and upper probability distributions.

Special cases:    if the right operand is nil, of_species returns the right operand   Examples:      list var0 <- (self neighbors_at 10) of_species (species (self)); // var0 equals all the neighboring agents of the same species.  list var1 <- test(0),test(1),node(1),node(2) of_species test; // var1 equals test0,test1       See also:  of_generic_species,    ### one_of  Possible use:    one_of (container<KeyType,ValueType>) —>  ValueType   Result: one of the values stored in this container  at a random key  Comment: the one_of operator behavior depends on the nature of the operand  Special cases:    if it is a graph, one_of returns one of the lists of edges   if it is a file, one_of returns one of the elements of the content of the file (that is also a container)   if the operand is empty, one_of returns nil                if it is a list or a matrix, one_of returns one of the values of the list or of the matrix    int  i <- any (1,2,3); //i equals 1, 2 or 3string sMat <- one_of(matrix(c11,c12,c13,c21,c22,c23));  // sMat equals c11,c12,c13, c21,c22 or c23       if it is a map, one_of returns one the value of a random pair of the map    int im <- one_of (2::3, 4::5, 6::7); // im equals 3, 5 or 7   bool var6 <- 2::3, 4::5, 6::7.values contains im; // var6 equals true      if it is a population, one_of returns one of the agents of the population    bug b <- one_of(bug);   // Given a previously defined species bug, b is one of the created bugs, e.g. bug3    See also:  contains,    ### open_simplex_generator  Possible use:    open_simplex_generator (float, float, float) —>  float   Result: take a x, y and a bias parameters and gives a value  Examples:      float var0 <- open_simplex_generator(2,3,253); // var0 equals 10.2         ### or  Possible use:    bool or any expression —>  bool   or (bool , any expression) —>  bool   Result: a bool value, equal to the logical or between the left-hand operand and the right-hand operand.

If this int parameter is equal to 0, the data is considered as already projected. opens a file that a is a kind of OSM file with some filtering.  Comment: The file should have a OSM file extension, cf. file type definition for supported file extensions.The file should have a OSM file extension, cf. file type definition for supported file extensions.  Special cases:    If the specified string does not refer to an existing OSM file, an exception is risen.   If the specified string does not refer to an existing OSM file, an exception is risen.   Examples:     file myOSMfile2 <- osm_file( ../includes/rouen.osm , highway :: primary , motorway , 0); file myOSMfile <- osm_file( ../includes/rouen.osm ,  highway :: primary , motorway );       See also:  file,    ### out_degree_of  Possible use:    graph out_degree_of unknown —>  int   out_degree_of (graph , unknown) —>  int   Result: returns the out degree of a vertex (right-hand operand) in the graph given as left-hand operand.

Comment: returns true when the left-operand only touches the right-operand. When one geometry covers partially (or fully) the other one, it returns false.  Special cases:    if one of the operand is null, returns false.   Examples:      bool var0 <- polyline({10,10},{20,20}) touches {15,15}; // var0 equals false  bool var1 <- polyline({10,10},{20,20}) touches {10,10}; // var1 equals true  bool var2 <- {15,15} touches {15,15}; // var2 equals false  bool var3 <- polyline({10,10},{20,20}) touches polyline({10,10},{5,5}); // var3 equals true  bool var4 <- polyline({10,10},{20,20}) touches polyline({5,5},{15,15}); // var4 equals false  bool var5 <- polyline({10,10},{20,20}) touches polyline({15,15},{25,25}); // var5 equals false  bool var6 <- polygon({10,10},{10,20},{20,20},{20,10}) touches polygon({15,15},{15,25},{25,25},{25,15}); // var6 equals false  bool var7 <- polygon({10,10},{10,20},{20,20},{20,10}) touches polygon({10,20},{20,20},{20,30},{10,30}); // var7 equals true  bool var8 <- polygon({10,10},{10,20},{20,20},{20,10}) touches polygon({10,10},{0,10},{0,0},{10,0}); // var8 equals true  bool var9 <- polygon({10,10},{10,20},{20,20},{20,10}) touches {15,15}; // var9 equals false  bool var10 <- polygon({10,10},{10,20},{20,20},{20,10}) touches {10,15}; // var10 equals true       See also:  disjoint_from, crosses, overlaps, partially_overlaps, intersects,    ### towards  Possible use:    geometry towards geometry —>  float   towards (geometry , geometry) —>  float   Result: The direction (in degree) between the two geometries (geometries, agents, points) considering the topology of the agent applying the operator.

See also:  rotated_by, translated_by,    ### translated_by  Possible use:    geometry translated_by point —>  geometry   translated_by (geometry , point) —>  geometry   Result: A geometry resulting from the application of a translation by the right-hand operand distance to the left-hand operand (geometry, agent, point)  Examples:      geometry var0 <- self translated_by {10,10,10}; // var0 equals the geometry resulting from applying the translation to the left-hand geometry (or agent).

Special cases:    when the operand is a point, it is read as {mean, standardDeviation}   if the operand is a list, only the two first elements are taken into account as mean, standardDeviation   when truncated_gauss is called with a list of only one element mean, it will always return 0.0   Examples:      float var0 <- truncated_gauss ({0, 0.3}); // var0 equals a float between -0.3 and 0.3  float var1 <- truncated_gauss (0.5, 0.0); // var1 equals 0.5       See also:  gauss,    ### type_of  Possible use:    type_of (unknown) —>  msi.gaml.types.IType<?>     ### undirected  Possible use:    undirected (graph) —>  graph   Result: the operand graph becomes an undirected graph.  Comment: the operator alters the operand graph, it does not create a new one.  See also:  directed,    ### union  Possible use:    union (container<geometry>) —>  geometry   container union container —>  list   union (container , container) —>  list   Result: returns a new list containing all the elements of both containers without duplicated elements.  Special cases:    if the left or right operand is nil, union throws an error   if the right-operand is a container of points, geometries or agents, returns the geometry resulting from the union all the geometries   Examples:      list var0 <- 1,2,3,4,5,6 union 2,4,9; // var0 equals 1,2,3,4,5,6,9  list var1 <- 1,2,3,4,5,6 union 0,8; // var1 equals 1,2,3,4,5,6,0,8  list var2 <- 1,3,2,4,5,6,8,5,6 union 0,8; // var2 equals 1,3,2,4,5,6,8,0  geometry var3 <- union(geom1, geom2, geom3); // var3 equals a geometry corresponding to union between geom1, geom2 and geom3       See also:  inter, +,    ### unknown  Possible use:    unknown (any) —>  unknown   Result: Casts the operand into the type unknown    ### until  Possible use:    until (date) —>  bool   any expression until date —>  bool   until (any expression , date) —>  bool   Result: Returns true if the current_date of the model is before (or equel to) the date passed in argument. Synonym of  current_date <= argument   Examples:     reflex when: until(starting_date) {}  // This reflex will be run only once at the beginning of the simulation         ### upper_case  Possible use:    upper_case (string) —>  string   Result: Converts all of the characters in the string operand to upper case  Examples:      string var0 <- upper_case( Abc ); // var0 equals  ABC        See also:  lower_case,    ### URL_file  Possible use:    URL_file (string) —>  file   Result: Constructs a file of type URL.

Comment: the operator alters the operand graph, it does not create a new one.  See also:  path_between,    ### user_input  Possible use:    user_input (any expression) —>  map<string,unknown>   string user_input any expression —>  map<string,unknown>   user_input (string , any expression) —>  map<string,unknown>   Result: asks the user for some values (not defined as parameters). Takes a string (optional) and a map as arguments. The string is used to specify the message of the dialog box. The map is to specify the parameters you want the user to change before the simulation starts, with the name of the parameter in string key, and the default value as value.  Comment: This operator takes a map string::value as argument, displays a dialog asking the user for these values, and returns the same map with the modified values (if any). The dialog is modal and will interrupt the execution of the simulation until the user has either dismissed or accepted it. It can be used, for instance, in an init section to force the user to input new values instead of relying on the initial values of parameters :  Examples:     map<string,unknown> values2 <- user_input( Enter numer of agents and locations , Number  :: 100,  Location  :: {10, 10}); create bug number: int(values2 at  Number ) with: location:: (point(values2 at  Location )); map<string,unknown> values <- user_input( Number  :: 100,  Location  :: {10, 10}); create bug number: int(values at  Number ) with: location:: (point(values at  Location ));         ### using  Possible use:    any expression using topology —>  unknown   using (any expression , topology) —>  unknown   Result: Allows to specify in which topology a spatial computation should take place.  Special cases:    has no effect if the topology passed as a parameter is nil   Examples:      unknown var0 <- (agents closest_to self) using topology(world); // var0 equals the closest agent to self (the caller) in the continuous topology of the world         ### variance  Possible use:    variance (container) —>  float   Result: the variance of the elements of the operand. See Variance for more details.  Comment: The operator casts all the numerical element of the list into float. The elements that are not numerical are discarded.  Examples:      float var0 <- variance (4.5, 3.5, 5.5, 7.0); // var0 equals 1.671875       See also:  mean, median,    ### variance  Possible use:    variance (float) —>  float   variance (int, float, float) —>  float   Result: Returns the variance of a data sequence. That is (sumOfSquares - mean*sum) / size with mean = sum/size.

Comment: In a localized graph, an edge has a weight by default (the distance between both vertices).  Special cases:    if the left-operand (the graph) is nil, returns nil   if the right-hand operand is not an edge of the given graph, weight_of checks whether it is a node of the graph and tries to return its weight   if the right-hand operand is neither a node, nor an edge, returns 1.   Examples:     graph graphFromMap <-  as_edge_graph({1,5}::{12,45},{12,45}::{34,56}); float var1 <- graphFromMap weight_of(link({1,5},{12,45})); // var1 equals 1.0         ### weighted_means_DM  Possible use:    msi.gama.util.IList<java.util.List> weighted_means_DM msi.gama.util.IList<java.util.Map<java.lang.String,java.lang.Object>> —>  int   weighted_means_DM (msi.gama.util.IList<java.util.List> , msi.gama.util.IList<java.util.Map<java.lang.String,java.lang.Object>>) —>  int   Result: The index of the candidate that maximizes the weighted mean of its criterion values. The first operand is the list of candidates (a candidate is a list of criterion values); the second operand the list of criterion (list of map)  Special cases:    returns -1 is the list of candidates is nil or empty   Examples:      int var0 <- weighted_means_DM(1.0, 7.0,4.0,2.0,3.0, 3.0,  name :: utility ,  weight  :: 2.0, name :: price ,  weight  :: 1.0); // var0 equals 1       See also:  promethee_DM, electre_DM, evidence_theory_DM,    ### where  Possible use:    container where any expression —>  list   where (container , any expression) —>  list   Result: a list containing all the elements of the left-hand operand that make the right-hand operand evaluate to true.

Special cases:    if the left-hand operand is nil, with_max_of returns the default value of the right-hand operand   Examples:      unknown var0 <- 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 with_max_of (each ); // var0 equals 8  unknown var2 <- g2 with_max_of (length(g2 out_edges_of each)  ) ; // var2 equals node4  unknown var3 <- (list(node) with_max_of (round(node(each).location.x)); // var3 equals node3  unknown var4 <- 1::2, 3::4, 5::6 with_max_of (each); // var4 equals 6       See also:  where, with_min_of,    ### with_min_of  Possible use:    container with_min_of any expression —>  unknown   with_min_of (container , any expression) —>  unknown   Result: one of elements of the left-hand operand that minimizes the value of the right-hand operand  Comment: in the right-hand operand, the keyword each can be used to represent, in turn, each of the right-hand operand elements.

Note that these methods are dynamic: the path is computed when needed. In contrarily, if the operand is another string, a static method will be used, i.e. all the shortest are previously computed.  Examples:     graphEpidemio <- graphEpidemio with_optimizer_type  static ;       See also:  set_verbose,    ### with_precision  Possible use:    float with_precision int —>  float   with_precision (float , int) —>  float   point with_precision int —>  point   with_precision (point , int) —>  point   geometry with_precision int —>  geometry   with_precision (geometry , int) —>  geometry   Result: Rounds off the value of left-hand operand to the precision given by the value of right-hand operand Rounds off the ordinates of the left-hand point to the precision given by the value of right-hand operand A geometry corresponding to the rounding of points of the operand considering a given precison.

See also:  round,    ### with_values  Possible use:    predicate with_values map —>  predicate   with_values (predicate , map) —>  predicate   Result: change the parameters of the given predicate  Examples:     predicate with_values  time ::10         ### with_weights  Possible use:    graph with_weights list —>  graph   with_weights (graph , list) —>  graph   graph with_weights map —>  graph   with_weights (graph , map) —>  graph   Result: returns the graph (left-hand operand) with weight given in the map (right-hand operand).  Comment: this operand re-initializes the path finder  Special cases:    if the right-hand operand is a list, affects the n elements of the list to the n first edges. Note that the ordering of edges may change overtime, which can create some problems…   if the left-hand operand is a map, the map should contains pairs such as: vertex/edge::double    graph_from_edges (list(ant) as_map each::one_of (list(ant))) with_weights (list(ant) as_map each::each.food)      ### without_holes  Possible use:    without_holes (geometry) —>  geometry   Result: A geometry corresponding to the operand geometry (geometry, agent, point) without its holes  Examples:      geometry var0 <- solid(self); // var0 equals the geometry corresponding to the geometry of the agent applying the operator without its holes.         ### writable  Possible use:    file writable bool —>  file   writable (file , bool) —>  file   Result: Marks the file as read-only or not, depending on the second boolean argument, and returns the first argument  Comment: A file is created using its native flags. This operator can change them. Beware that this change is system-wide (and not only restrained to GAMA): changing a file to read-only mode (e.g.  writable(f, false) )  Examples:      file var0 <- shape_file( ../images/point_eau.shp ) writable false; // var0 equals returns a file in read-only mode       See also:  file,    ### xml_file  Possible use:    xml_file (string) —>  file   Result: Constructs a file of type xml. Allowed extensions are limited to xml    ### xor  Possible use:    bool xor bool —>  bool   xor (bool , bool) —>  bool   Result: a bool value, equal to the logical xor between the left-hand operand and the right-hand operand.

See also:  or, and, !,    ### years_between  Possible use:    date years_between date —>  int   years_between (date , date) —>  int   Result: Provide the exact number of years between two dates. This number can be positive or negative (if the second operand is smaller than the first one)  Examples:      int var0 <- years_between(date( 2000-01-01 ), date( 2010-01-01 )); // var0 equals 10       ","url":"wiki/OperatorsSplitted.md"},{"id":"wiki/UnitsAndConstantsPDF.md","title":" Units and constants","content":"Units and constants    This file is automatically generated from java files. Do Not Edit It.    Introduction Units can be used to qualify the values of numeric variables. By default, unqualified values are considered as: * meters for distances, lengths… * seconds for durations * cubic meters for volumes * kilograms for masses  So, an expression like:  float foo <- 1;   will be considered as 1 meter if foo is a distance, or 1 second if it is a duration, or 1 meter/second if it is a speed. If one wants to specify the unit, it can be done very simply by adding the unit symbol (° or #) followed by an unit name after the numeric value, like:   float foo <- 1 °centimeter;   or   float foo <- 1 #centimeter;   In that case, the numeric value of foo will be automatically translated to 0.01 (meter). It is recommended to always use float as the type of the variables that might be qualified by units (otherwise, for example in the previous case, they might be truncated to 0).  Several units names are allowed as qualifiers of numeric variables.  These units represent the basic metric and US units. Composed and derived units (like velocity, acceleration, special volumes or surfaces) can be obtained by combining these units using the * and / operators. For instance:  float one_kmh <- 1 °km / °h const: true; float one_millisecond <-1 °sec / 1000; float one_cubic_inch <- 1 °sqin * 1 °inch; ... etc ...

All its components (attributes, actions) will then be inherited by all direct or indirect children species (including model and experiment), with the exception of species that explicitly mention use_minimal_agents: true as a facet, which inherit from a stripped-down version of agent (see below).  agent attributes agent defines several attributes, which form the minimal set of knowledge any agent will have in a model.   *  agent actions ","url":"wiki/AgentBuiltIn.md"},{"id":"wiki/PseudoVariables.md","title":" Pseudo-variables","content":"# Pseudo-variables  The expressions known as pseudo-variables are special read-only variables that are not declared anywhere (at least not in a species), and which represent a value that changes depending on the context of execution.  Table of contents     Pseudo-variables  self       myself       each       super self The pseudo-variable self always holds a reference to the agent executing the current statement.     Example (sets the friend attribute of another random agent of the same species to self and conversely):    friend potential_friend <- one_of (species(self) - self); if potential_friend != nil {     potential_friend.friend <- self;     friend <- potential_friend; }   super The pseudo-variable super behaves exactly in the same way as self except when calling an action, in which case it represents an indirection to the parent species. It is mainly used for allowing to call inherited actions within redefined ones. For instance:      species parent {  int add(int a, int b) {     return a + b; }   }  species child parent: parent {  int add(int a, int b) {     // Calls the action defined in  parent  with modified arguments     return super.add(a + 20, b + 20); }   }      myself myself plays the same role as self but in remotely-executed code (ask, create, capture and release statements), where it represents the calling agent when the code is executed by the remote agent.     Example (asks the first agent of my species to set its color to my color):    ask first (species (self)){     color <- myself.color; }      Example (create 10 new agents of the species of my species, share the energy between them, turn them towards me, and make them move 4 times to get closer to me):    create species (self) number: 10 {    energy <- myself.energy / 10.0;    loop times: 4 { heading <- towards (myself); do move;    } }   each each is available only in the right-hand argument of iterators.  It is a pseudo-variable that represents, in turn, each of the elements of the left-hand container. It can then take any type depending on the context.

It is possible to load a file using the file operator:   file my_file <- file(../includes/data.csv);   However, internally, GAMA makes the difference between the different types of files. Indeed, for instance:  global {  init {   file my_file <- file(../includes/data.csv);   loop el over: my_file {    write el;   }  } }   will give:  sepallength sepalwidth petallength petalwidth type 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 Iris-setosa 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 Iris-setosa ...  Indeed, the content of CSV file is a matrix: each row of the matrix is a line of the file; each column of the matrix is value delimited by the separator (by default  , ).  In contrary:  global {  init {   file my_file <- file(../includes/data.shp);   loop el over: my_file {    write el;   }  } }   will give:  Polygon Polygon Polygon Polygon Polygon Polygon Polygon  The content of a shapefile is a list of geometries corresponding to the objects of the shapefile.  In order to know how to load a file, GAMA analyzes its extension. For instance for a file with a  .csv  extension, GAMA knows that the file is a csv one and will try to split each line with the , separator. However, if the modeler wants to split each line with a different separator (for instance ;) or load it as a text file, he/she will have to use a specific file operator.  Indeed, GAMA integrates specific operators corresponding to different types of files.

For example, for files with  .csv  extension, GAMA will cast them as csv file and not as text file.  Content The content of a text file is a list of string corresponding to each line of the text file. For example:  global {  init {   file my_file <- text_file(../includes/data.txt);   loop el over: my_file {    write el;   }  } }   will give:  sepallength,sepalwidth,petallength,petalwidth,type 5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa 4.9,3.0,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa 4.7,3.2,1.3,0.2,Iris-setosa   Operators List of operators related to text files:   * text_file(string path): load a file (with an authorized extension) as a text file.   * text_file(string path, list content): load a file (with an authorized extension) as a text file and fill it with the given content.   * is_text(op): tests whether the operand is a text file  CSV File ### Extensions Here the list of possible extensions for csv file:     *  csv      *  tsv   Content The content of a csv file is a matrix of string: each row of the matrix is a line of the file; each column of the matrix is value delimited by the separator (by default  , ).

The data produced in this project (OSM File)  represent physical features on the ground (e.g., roads or buildings) using tags attached to its basic data structures (its nodes, ways, and relations). Each tag describes a geographic attribute of the feature being shown by that specific node, way or relation (source: openstreetmap.org).  More details about OSM data can be found here.

syntax  A statement represents either a declaration or an imperative command. It consists in a keyword, followed by specific facets, some of them mandatory (in bold), some of them optional. One of the facet names can be omitted (the one denoted as omissible). It has to be the first one.   statement_keyword expression1 facet2: expression2 ... ; or statement_keyword facet1: expression1 facet2: expression2 ...;   If the statement encloses other statements, it is called a sequence statement, and its sub-statements (either sequence statements or single statements) are declared between curly brackets, as in:   statement_keyword1 expression1 facet2: expression2... { // a sequence statement      statement_keyword2 expression1 facet2: expression2...;  // a single statement      statement_keyword3 expression1 facet2: expression2...; }     ### =  #### Facets     right (float), (omissible) : the right part of the equation (it is mandatory that it can be evaluated as a float   left (any type): the left part of the equation (it should be a variable or a call to the diff() or diff2() operators)   Definition  Allows to implement an equation in the form function(n, t) = expression. The left function is only here as a placeholder for enabling a simpler syntax and grabbing the variable as its left member.  Usages     The syntax of the = statement is a bit different from the other statements. It has to be used as follows (in an equation):    float t; float S; float I; equation SI {     diff(S,t) = (- 0.3 * S * I / 100);    diff(I,t) = (0.3 * S * I / 100); } See also: equation, solve,   Embedments    The = statement is of type: Single statement   The = statement can be embedded into: equation,   The = statement embeds statements:     ### action  #### Facets     name (an identifier), (omissible) : identifier of the action   index (a datatype identifier): if the action returns a map, the type of its keys   of (a datatype identifier): if the action returns a container, the type of its elements   type (a datatype identifier): the action returned type   virtual (boolean): whether the action is virtual (defined without a set of instructions) (false by default)   Definition  Allows to define in a species, model or experiment a new action that can be called elsewhere.  Usages     The simplest syntax to define an action that does not take any parameter and does not return anything is:    action simple_action {    // set of statements }       If the action needs some parameters, they can be specified betwee, braquets after the identifier of the action:    action action_parameters(int i, string s){    // set of statements using i and s }       If the action returns any value, the returned type should be used instead of the  action  keyword. A return statement inside the body of the action statement is mandatory.    int action_return_val(int i, string s){    // set of statements using i and s    return i + i; }       If virtual: is true, then the action is abstract, which means that the action is defined without body. A species containing at least one abstract action is abstract. Agents of this species cannot be created. The common use of an abstract action is to define an action that can be used by all its sub-species, which should redefine all abstract actions and implements its body.    species parent_species {    int virtual_action(int i, string s); }  species children parent: parent_species {    int virtual_action(int i, string s) {       return i + i;    } }       See also: do,   Embedments    The action statement is of type: Sequence of statements or action   The action statement can be embedded into: Species, Experiment, Model,   The action statement embeds statements: assert,  return,     ### add  #### Facets     to (any type in container, species, agent, geometry): an expression that evaluates to a container   item (any type), (omissible) : any expression to add in the container   all (any type): Allows to either pass a container so as to add all its element, or  true , if the item to add is already a container.   at (any type): position in the container of added element   edge (any type): a pair that will be added to a graph as an edge (if nodes do not exist, they are also added)   node (any type): an expression that will be added to a graph as a node.   vertex (any type):   weight (float): An optional float value representing the weight to attach to this element in case the container is a graph   Definition  Allows to add, i.e. to insert, a new element in a container (a list, matrix, map, …).Incorrect use: The addition of a new element at a position out of the bounds of the container will produce a warning and let the container unmodified. If all: is specified, it has no effect if its argument is not a container, or if its argument is  true  and the item to add is not a container. In that latter case  Usages     The new element can be added either at the end of the container or at a particular position.    add expr to: expr_container;    // Add at the end add expr at: expr to: expr_container;   // Add at position expr       Case of a list, the expression in the facet at: should be an integer.    list<int> workingList <- ; add 0 at: 0 to: workingList ;//workingList equals 0add 10 at: 0 to: workingList ;//workingList equals 10,0add 20 at: 2 to: workingList ;//workingList equals 10,0,20add 50 to: workingList;//workingList equals 10,0,20,50add 60,70 all: true to: workingList;//workingList equals 10,0,20,50,60,70      Case of a map: As a map is basically a list of pairs key::value, we can also use the add statement on it. It is important to note that the behavior of the statement is slightly different, in particular in the use of the at facet, which denotes the key of the pair.    map<string,string> workingMap <- ; add val1 at: x to: workingMap;//workingMap equals x::val1      If the at facet is omitted, a pair expr_item::expr_item will be added to the map. An important exception is the case where the expr_item is a pair: in this case the pair is added.    add val2 to: workingMap;//workingMap equals x::val1, val2::val2add 5::val4 to: workingMap; //workingMap equals x::val1, val2::val2, 5::val4      Notice that, as the key should be unique, the addition of an item at an existing position (i.e. existing key) will only modify the value associated with the given key.    add val3 at: x to: workingMap;//workingMap equals x::val3, val2::val2, 5::val4      On a map, the all facet will add all value of a container  in the map (so as pair val_cont::val_cont)    add val4,val5 all: true at: x to: workingMap;//workingMap equals x::val3, val2::val2, 5::val4,val4::val4,val5::val5      In case of a graph, we can use the facets node, edge and weight to add a node, an edge or weights to the graph. However, these facets are now considered as deprecated, and it is advised to use the various edge(), node(), edges(), nodes() operators, which can build the correct objects to add to the graph    graph g <- as_edge_graph({1,5}::{12,45}); add edge: {1,5}::{2,3} to: g;   list var <- g.vertices; // var equals {1,5},{12,45},{2,3}  list var <- g.edges; // var equals polyline({1.0,5.0}::{12.0,45.0}),polyline({1.0,5.0}::{2.0,3.0})add node: {5,5} to: g;   list var <- g.vertices; // var equals {1.0,5.0},{12.0,45.0},{2.0,3.0},{5.0,5.0}  list var <- g.edges; // var equals polyline({1.0,5.0}::{12.0,45.0}),polyline({1.0,5.0}::{2.0,3.0})      Case of a matrix: this statement can not be used on matrix.

Note that if coordinates are in 0,1, the position is relative to the size of the environment (e.g. {0.5,0.5} refers to the middle of the display) whereas it is absolute when coordinates are greater than 1 for x and y. The z-ordinate can only be defined between 0 and 1. The position can only be a 3D point {0.5, 0.5, 0.5}, the last coordinate specifying the elevation of the layer.   refresh (boolean): (openGL only) specify whether the display of the species is refreshed.

All the statements will be evaluated in the context of the receiver agent(s), as if they were defined in their species, which means that an expression like self will represent the receiver agent and not the sender. If the sender needs to refer to itself, some of its own attributes (or temporary variables) within the block statements, it has to use the keyword myself.    species animal {     float energy <- rnd (1000) min: 0.0 {     reflex when: energy > 500 { // executed when the energy is above the given threshold   list<animal> others <- (animal at_distance 5); // find all the neighboring animals in a radius of 5 meters   float shared_energy  <- (energy - 500) / length (others); // compute the amount of energy to share with each of them   ask others { // no need to cast, since others has already been filtered to only include animals     if (energy < 500) { // refers to the energy of each animal in others   energy <- energy + myself.shared_energy; // increases the energy of each animal   myself.energy <- myself.energy - myself.shared_energy; // decreases the energy of the sender     }   }     } }       If the species of the receiver agent cannot be determined, it is possible to force it by casting the agent.

In case of a 3D layer, a 3D point can be used (note that {1,1} is equivalent to {1,1,0}, so a resize of a layer containing 3D objects with a 2D points will remove the elevation)   style (an identifier), takes values in: {line, whisker, area, bar, dot, step, spline, stack, 3d, ring, exploded, default}: The sub-style style, also default style for the series.   tick_font (string): Tick font face   tick_font_size (int): Tick font size   tick_font_style (an identifier), takes values in: {plain, bold, italic}: the style used to display ticks   tick_line_color (rgb): the tick lines color   title_font (string): Title font face   title_font_size (int): Title font size   title_font_style (an identifier), takes values in: {plain, bold, italic}: the style used to display titles   title_visible (boolean): chart title visible   type (an identifier), takes values in: {xy, scatter, histogram, series, pie, radar, heatmap, box_whisker}: the type of chart. It could be histogram, series, xy, pie, radar, heatmap or box whisker. The difference between series and xy is that the former adds an implicit x-axis that refers to the numbers of cycles, while the latter considers the first declaration of data to be its x-axis.   x_label (string): the title for the X axis   x_log_scale (boolean): use Log Scale for X axis   x_range (any type in float, int, point, list): range of the x-axis.

Can be a number (which will set the axis total range) or a point (which will set the min and max of the axis).   Definition  chart allows modeler to display a chart: this enables to display specific values of the model at each iteration. GAMA can display various chart types: time series (series), pie charts (pie) and histograms (histogram).

In the case of simulations, the name  simulation , which represents the current instance of simulation, can also be used as a proxy to their species   as (species):   from (any type): an expression that evaluates to a localized entity, a list of localized entities, a string (the path of a file), a file (shapefile, a .csv, a .asc or a OSM file) or a container returned by a request to a database   header (boolean): an expression that evaluates to a boolean, when creating agents from csv file, specify whether the file header is loaded   number (int): an expression that evaluates to an int, the number of created agents   returns (a new identifier): a new temporary variable name containing the list of created agents (a list, even if only one agent has been created)   with (map): an expression that evaluates to a map, for each pair the key is a species attribute and the value the assigned value   Definition  Allows an agent to create number agents of species species, to create agents of species species from a shapefile or to create agents of species species from one or several localized entities (discretization of the localized entity geometries).  Usages     Its simple syntax to create an_int agents of species a_species is:    create a_species number: an_int; create species_of(self) number: 5 returns: list5Agents; 5       In GAML modelers can create agents of species a_species  (with two attributes type and nature with types corresponding to the types of the shapefile attributes) from a shapefile the_shapefile  while reading attributes  TYPE_OCC  and  NATURE  of the shapefile. One agent will be created by object contained in the shapefile:    create a_species from: the_shapefile with: type:: read( TYPE_OCC ), nature::read( NATURE );       In order to create agents from a .csv file, facet header can be used to specified whether we can use columns header:    create toto from: toto.csv header: true with:att1::read(NAME), att2::read(TYPE); or create toto from: toto.csv with:att1::read(0), att2::read(1); //with read(int), the index of the column       Similarly to the creation from shapefile, modelers can create agents from a set of geometries. In this case, one agent per geometry will be created (with the geometry as shape)    create species_of(self) from: square(4),circle(4);  // 2 agents have been created, with shapes respectively square(4) and circle(4)       Created agents are initialized following the rules of their species. If one wants to refer to them after the statement is executed, the returns keyword has to be defined: the agents created will then be referred to by the temporary variable it declares. For instance, the following statement creates 0 to 4 agents of the same species as the sender, and puts them in the temporary variable children for later use.    create species (self) number: rnd (4) returns: children; ask children {  // ... }       If one wants to specify a special initialization sequence for the agents created, create provides the same possibilities as ask. This extended syntax is:    create a_species number: an_int {      statements }       The same rules as in ask apply. The only difference is that, for the agents created, the assignments of variables will bypass the initialization defined in species.

If propagation equals  diffusion , the intensity of a signal is shared between its neighbors with respect to  proportion ,  variation  and the number of neighbors of the environment places (4, 6 or 8). I.e., for a given signal S propagated from place P, the value transmitted to its N neighbors is : S  = (S / N / proportion) - variation. The intensity of S is then diminished by S * proportion on P. In a diffusion, the different signals of the same name see their intensities added to each other on each place. If propagation equals  gradient , the original intensity is not modified, and each neighbors receives the intensity : S / proportion - variation. If multiple propagation occur at once, only the maximum intensity is kept on each place.

Be aware that there are no prevention of infinite loops. As a consequence, open loops should be used with caution, as one agent may block the execution of the whole model.  Usages     The basic syntax for repeating a fixed number of times a set of statements is:    loop times: an_int_expression {      // statements }       The basic syntax for repeating a set of statements while a condition holds is:    loop while: a_bool_expression {      // statements }       The basic syntax for repeating a set of statements by progressing over a container of a point is:    loop a_temp_var over: a_collection_expression {      // statements }       The basic syntax for repeating a set of statements while an index iterates over a range of values with a fixed step of 1 is:    loop a_temp_var from: int_expression_1 to: int_expression_2 {      // statements }       The incrementation step of the index can also be chosen:    loop a_temp_var from: int_expression_1 to: int_expression_2 step: int_expression3 {      // statements }       In these latter three cases, the name facet designates the name of a temporary variable, whose scope is the loop, and that takes, in turn, the value of each of the element of the list (or each value in the interval).

The from and to facets take an integer expression as arguments, with the first (resp. the last) specifying the beginning (resp. end) of the inclusive interval (i.e. to, from). If the step is not defined, it is assumed to be equal to 1 or -1, depending on the direction of the range.

This Reactive Tabu Search is an enhance version of the Tabu search. It adds two new elements to the classic Tabu Search. The first one concerns the size of the tabu list: in the Reactive Tabu Search, this one is not constant anymore but it dynamically evolves according to the context. Thus, when the exploration process visits too often the same solutions, the tabu list is extended in order to favor the diversification of the search process. On the other hand, when the process has not visited an already known solution for a high number of iterations, the tabu list is shortened in order to favor the intensification of the search process. The second new element concerns the adding of cycle detection capacities. Thus, when a cycle is detected, the process applies random movements in order to break the cycle. See batch161 the batch dedicated page.  Usages     As other batch methods, the basic syntax of the reactive_tabu statement uses method reactive_tabu instead of the expected reactive_tabu name: id :    method reactive_tabu facet: value;       For example:    method reactive_tabu iter_max: 50 tabu_list_size_init: 5 tabu_list_size_min: 2 tabu_list_size_max: 10 nb_tests_wthout_col_max: 20 cycle_size_min: 2 cycle_size_max: 20 maximize: food_gathered;    Embedments    The reactive_tabu statement is of type: Batch method   The reactive_tabu statement can be embedded into: Experiment,   The reactive_tabu statement embeds statements:     ### reflex  #### Facets     name (an identifier), (omissible) : the identifier of the reflex   when (boolean): an expression that evaluates a boolean, the condition to fulfill in order to execute the statements embedded in the reflex.

Reflexes prefixed by  init  are executed only immediately after the agent has been created. Reflexes prefixed by  abort  just before the agent is killed. If a facet when: is defined, a reflex is executed only if the boolean expression evaluates to true.

The preliminary for an agent to release its micro-agents is that species of these micro-agents are sub-species of other species (cf. Species161#Nesting_species Nesting species). The released agents won t be micro-agents of the calling agent anymore. Being released from a macro-agent, the micro-agents will change their species and host (macro-agent).  Usages     We consider the following species. Agents of  C  species can be released from a  B  agent to become agents of  A  species. Agents of  D  species cannot be released from the  A  agent because species  D  has no parent species.    species A { ... } species B { ...    species C parent: A {    ...    }    species D {    ...    } ... }       To release all  C  agents from a  B  agent, agent  C  has to execute the following statement. The  C  agent will change to  A  agent. The won t consider  B  agent as their macro-agent (host) anymore. Their host (macro-agent) will the be the host (macro-agent) of the  B  agent.    release list(C);       The modeler can specify the new host and the new species of the released agents:    release list (C) as: new_species in: new host;       See also: capture,   Embedments    The release statement is of type: Sequence of statements or action   The release statement can be embedded into: Behavior, Sequence of statements or action,   The release statement embeds statements:     ### remove  #### Facets     from (any type in container, species, agent, geometry): an expression that evaluates to a container   item (any type), (omissible) : any expression to remove from the container   all (any type): an expression that evaluates to a container.

Usages     This statement should be used in the following ways, depending on the kind of container used and the expected action on it:    remove expr from: expr_container; remove index: expr from: expr_container; remove key: expr from: expr_container; remove all: expr from: expr_container;       In the case of list, the facet item: is used to remove the first occurence of a given expression, whereas all is used to remove all the occurrences of the given expression.    list<int> removeList <- 3,2,1,2,3; remove 2 from: removeList;//removeList equals 3,1,2,3remove 3 all: true from: removeList;//removeList equals 1,2remove index: 1 from: removeList;//removeList equals 1      In the case of map, the facet key: is used to remove the pair identified by the given key.    map<string,int> removeMap <- x::5, y::7, z::7; remove key: x from: removeMap;//removeMap equals y::7, z::7remove 7 all: true from: removeMap;//removeMap equals map()      In addition, a map a be managed as a list with pair key as index. Given that, facets item:, all: and index: can be used in the same way:    map<string,int> removeMapList <- x::5, y::7, z::7, t::5; remove 7 from: removeMapList;//removeMapList equals x::5, z::7, t::5remove 5,7 all: true from: removeMapList;//removeMapList equals t::5remove index: t from: removeMapList;//removeMapList equals map()      In the case of a graph, both edges and nodes can be removes using node: and edge facets. If a node is removed, all edges to and from this node are also removed.    graph removeGraph <- as_edge_graph({1,2}::{3,4},{3,4}::{5,6}); remove node: {1,2} from: removeGraph; remove node(1,2) from: removeGraph;   list var <- removeGraph.vertices; // var equals {3,4},{5,6}  list var <- removeGraph.edges; // var equals polyline({3,4}::{5,6})remove edge: {3,4}::{5,6} from: removeGraph; remove edge({3,4},{5,6}) from: removeGraph;   list var <- removeGraph.vertices; // var equals {3,4},{5,6}  list var <- removeGraph.edges; // var equals       In the case of an agent or a shape, remove allows to remove an attribute from the attributes map of the receiver. However, for agents, it will only remove attributes that have been added dynamically, not the ones defined in the species or in its built-in parent.    global {    init {       create speciesRemove;       speciesRemove sR <- speciesRemove(0);  // sR.a now equals 100       remove key:a from: sR;  // sR.a now equals nil    } }  species speciesRemove {    int a <- 100;  }       This statement can not be used on matrix.

Do Not Edit It.    Introduction Units can be used to qualify the values of numeric variables. By default, unqualified values are considered as: * meters for distances, lengths… * seconds for durations * cubic meters for volumes * kilograms for masses  So, an expression like:  float foo <- 1;   will be considered as 1 meter if foo is a distance, or 1 second if it is a duration, or 1 meter/second if it is a speed. If one wants to specify the unit, it can be done very simply by adding the unit symbol (° or #) followed by an unit name after the numeric value, like:   float foo <- 1 °centimeter;   or   float foo <- 1 #centimeter;   In that case, the numeric value of foo will be automatically translated to 0.01 (meter). It is recommended to always use float as the type of the variables that might be qualified by units (otherwise, for example in the previous case, they might be truncated to 0).  Several units names are allowed as qualifiers of numeric variables.  These units represent the basic metric and US units. Composed and derived units (like velocity, acceleration, special volumes or surfaces) can be obtained by combining these units using the * and / operators. For instance:  float one_kmh <- 1 °km / °h const: true; float one_millisecond <-1 °sec / 1000; float one_cubic_inch <- 1 °sqin * 1 °inch; ... etc ...

Do Not Edit It.    Introduction  Skills are built-in modules, written in Java, that provide a set of related built-in variables and built-in actions (in addition to those already provided by GAMA) to the species that declare them. A declaration of skill is done by filling the skills attribute in the species definition:   species my_species skills: skill1, skill2 {     ... }   Skills have been designed to be mutually compatible so that any combination of them will result in a functional species. An example of skill is the moving skill.  So, for instance, if a species is declared as:   species foo skills: moving{ ... }   Its agents will automatically be provided with the following variables : speed, heading, destination and the following actions: move, goto, wander, follow in addition to those built-in in species and declared by the modeller. Most of these variables, except the ones marked read-only, can be customized and modified like normal variables by the modeller. For instance, one could want to set a maximum for the speed; this would be done by redeclaring it like this:   float speed max:100 min:0;   Or, to obtain a speed increasing at each simulation step:   float speed max:100 min:0  <- 1 update: speed * 1.01;   Or, to change the speed in a behavior:   if speed = 5 {     speed <- 10; }     Table of Contents   advanced_driving, driving, fipa, GAMASQL, MDXSKILL, messaging, moving, moving3D, network, physics, skill_road, skill_road_node, SQLSKILL,    ## advanced_driving  Variables     current_index (int): the current index of the agent target (according to the targets list)   current_lane (int): the current lane on which the agent is   current_path (path): the current path that tha agent follow   current_road (agent): current road on which the agent is   current_target (point): the current target of the agent   distance_to_goal (float): euclidean distance to the next point of the current segment   final_target (point): the final target of the agent   max_acceleration (float): maximum acceleration of the car for a cycle   max_speed (float): maximal speed of the vehicle   min_security_distance (float): the minimal distance to another driver   on_linked_road (boolean): is the agent on the linked road?   proba_block_node (float): probability to block a node (do not let other driver cross the crossroad)   proba_lane_change_down (float): probability to change lane to a lower lane (right lane if right side driving) if necessary   proba_lane_change_up (float): probability to change lane to a upper lane (left lane if right side driving) if necessary   proba_respect_priorities (float): probability to respect priority (right or left) laws   proba_respect_stops (list): probability to respect stop laws -

GAML is a statically-typed language, which means that the type of an expression is always known at compile time, and is even enforced with casting operations. There are 4 categories of types:     primitive types, declared as keyword in the language,   complex types, also declared as keyword in the language,   parametric types, a refinement of complex types (mainly children of container) that is dynamically constructed using an enclosing type, a contents type and a key type,   species types, dynamically constructed from the species declarations made by the modeler (and the built-in species present).   The hierarchy of types in GAML (only primitive and complex types are displayed here, of course, as the other ones are model-dependent) is the following:    Table of contents     Types (Under Construction)  Primitive built-in types   bool float int string   Complex built-in types   agent container file geometry graph list map matrix pair path point rgb species Species names as types topology   Defining custom types Primitive built-in types  bool    Definition: primitive datatype providing two values: true or false.   Litteral declaration: both true or false are interpreted as boolean constants.   Other declarations: expressions that require a boolean operand often directly apply a casting to bool to their operand. It is a convenient way to directly obtain a bool value.    bool (0) -> false  Top of the page  ### float   * Definition: primitive datatype holding floating point values, its absolute value is comprised between 4.9E-324 and 1.8E308.   * Comments: this datatype is internally backed up by the Java double datatype.   * Litteral declaration: decimal notation 123.45 or exponential notation 123e45 are supported.   * Other declarations: expressions that require an integer operand often directly apply a casting to float to their operand. Using it is a way to obtain a float constant.   float (12) -> 12.0  Top of the page  ### int   * Definition: primitive datatype holding integer values comprised between -2147483648 and 2147483647 (i.e. between -2^31 and 2^31 - 1.   * Comments: this datatype is internally backed up by the Java int datatype.   * Litteral declaration: decimal notation like 1, 256790 or hexadecimal notation like #1209FF are automatically interpreted.   * Other declarations: expressions that require an integer operand often directly apply a casting to int to their operand. Using it is a way to obtain an integer constant.   int (234.5) -> 234.  Top of the page  ### string   * Definition: a datatype holding a sequence of characters.   * Comments: this datatype is internally backed up by the Java String class. However, contrary to Java, strings are considered as a primitive type, which means they do not contain character objects. This can be seen when casting a string to a list using the list operator: the result is a list of one-character strings, not a list of characters.   * Litteral declaration: a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes, like  this is a string  . If one wants to literally declare strings that contain quotes, one has to double these quotes in the declaration. Strings accept escape characters like \\n (newline),   (carriage return),   (tabulation), as well as any Unicode character (\\uXXXX).   * Other declarations: see string   * Example: see string operators.  Top of the page  Complex built-in types  Contrarily to primitive built-in types, complex types have often various attributes. They can be accessed in the same way as attributes of agents:  complex_type nom_var <- init_var; ltype_attr attr_var <- nom_var.attr_name;  For example:  file fileText <- file(../data/cell.Data); bool fileTextReadable <- fileText.readable;   ### agent   * Definition: a generic datatype that represents an agent whatever its actual species.   * Comments: This datatype is barely used, since species can be directly used as datatypes themselves.   * Declaration: the agent casting operator can be applied to an int (to get the agent with this unique index), a string (to get the agent with this name).  Top of the page  ### container   * Definition: a generic datatype that represents a collection of data.   * Comments:  a container variable can be a list, a matrix, a map… Conversely each list, matrix and map is a kind of container. In consequence every container can be used in container-related operators.   * See also: Container operators   * Declaration:  container c  <- 1,2,3; container c  <- matrix 1,2,3,4,5,6; container c  <- map x::5, y::12; container c  <- list species1;  Top of the page  ### file   * Definition: a datatype that represents a file.   * Built-in attributes:     * name (type = string): the name of the represented file (with its extension)     * extension(type = string): the extension of the file     * path (type = string): the absolute path of the file     * readable (type = bool, read-only): a flag expressing whether the file is readable     * writable (type = bool, read-only): a flag expressing whether the file is writable     * exists (type = bool, read-only): a flag expressing whether the file exists     * is_folder (type = bool, read-only): a flag expressing whether the file is folder     * contents (type = container): a container storing the content of the file   * Comments: a variable with the file type can handle any kind of file (text, image or shape files…). The type of the content attribute will depend on the kind of file. Note that the allowed kinds of file are the followings:     * text files: files with the extensions .txt, .data, .csv, .text, .tsv, .asc. The content is by default a list of string.     * image files: files with the extensions .pgm, .tif, .tiff, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .pict, .bmp. The content is by default a matrix of int.     * shapefiles: files with the extension .shp. The content is by default a list of geometry.     * properties files: files with the extension .properties. The content is by default a map of string::string.     * folders. The content is by default a list of string.   * Remark: Files are also a particular kind of container and can thus be read, written or iterated using the container operators and commands.   * See also: File operators   * Declaration: a file can be created using the generic file (that opens a file in read only mode and tries to determine its contents), folder or the new_folder (to open an existing folder or create a new one) unary operators. But things can be specialized with the combination of the read/write and image/text/shapefile/properties unary operators.      folder(a_string)  // returns a file managing a existing folder file(a_string) // returns any kind of file in read-only mode read(text(a_string)) // returns a text file in read-only mode read(image(a_string)) // does the same with an image file. write(properties(a_string)) // returns a property file which is available for writing   // (if it exists, contents will be appended unless it is cleared   // using the standard container operations).       Top of the page  ### geometry   * Definition: a datatype that represents a vector geometry, i.e. a list of georeferenced points.   * Built-in attributes:     * location (type = point): the centroid of the geometry     * area (type = float): the area of the geometry     * perimeter (type = float): the perimeter of the geometry     * holes (type = list of geometry): the list of the hole inside the given geometry     * contour (type = geometry): the exterior ring of the given geometry and of his holes     * envelope (type = geometry): the geometry bounding box     * width (type = float): the width of the bounding box     * height (type = float): the height of the bounding box     * points (type = list of point): the set of the points composing the geometry   * Comments: a geometry can be either a point, a polyline or a polygon. Operators working on geometries handle transparently these three kinds of geometry. The envelope (a.k.a. the bounding box) of the geometry depends on the kind of geometry:     * If this Geometry is the empty geometry, it is an empty point.     * If the Geometry is a point, it is a non-empty point.     * Otherwise, it is a Polygon whose points are (minx, miny), (maxx, miny), (maxx, maxy), (minx, maxy), (minx, miny).   * See also: Spatial operators   * Declaration: geometries can be built from a point, a list of points or by using specific operators (circle, square, triangle…).   geometry varGeom <- circle(5); geometry polygonGeom <- polygon({3,5}, {5,6},{1,4});   Top of the page  ### graph   * Definition: a datatype that represents a graph composed of vertices linked by edges.   * Built-in attributes:     * edges(type = list of agent/geometry): the list of all edges     * vertices(type = list of agent/geometry): the list of all vertices     * circuit (type = path): an approximate minimal traveling salesman tour (hamiltonian cycle)     * spanning_tree (type = list of agent/geometry): minimum spanning tree of the graph, i.e. a sub-graph such as every vertex lies in the tree, and as much edges lies in it but no cycles (or loops) are formed.     * connected(type = bool): test whether the graph is connected   * Remark:     * graphs are also a particular kind of container and can thus be manipulated using the container operators and commands.     * This algorithm used to compute the circuit requires that the graph be complete and the triangle inequality exists (if x,y,z are vertices then d(x,y)+d(y,z)<d(x,z) for all x,y,z) then this algorithm will guarantee a hamiltonian cycle such that the total weight of the cycle is less than or equal to double the total weight of the optimal hamiltonian cycle.     * The computation of the spanning tree uses an implementation of  the Kruskal s minimum spanning tree algorithm. If the given graph is connected it computes the minimum spanning tree, otherwise it computes the minimum spanning forest.   * See also: Graph operators   * Declaration: graphs can be built from a list of vertices (agents or geometries) or from a list of edges (agents or geometries) by using specific operators. They are often used to deal with a road network and are built from a shapefile.      create road from: shape_file_road; graph the_graph <- as_edge_graph(road);  graph(1,9,5) –: (1: in + out, 5: in + out, 9: in + out, ) graph(node(0), node(1), node(2)      // if node is a species graph( a ::345,  b ::13)  –:  (b: in + outb::13, a: in + outa::345, 13: inb::13 + out, 345: ina::345 + out, a::345=(a,345), b::13=(b,13)) graph(a_graph)  –: a_graph graph(node1)    –: null      Top of the page  ### list   * Definition: a composite datatype holding an ordered collection of values.   * Comments: lists are more or less equivalent to instances of ArrayList in Java (although they are backed up by a specific class). They grow and shrink as needed, can be accessed via an index (see @ or index_of), support set operations (like union and difference), and provide the modeller with a number of utilities that make it easy to deal with collections of agents (see, for instance, shuffle, reverse,where,sort_by,…).   * Remark: lists can contain values of any datatypes, including other lists. Note, however, that due to limitations in the current parser, lists of lists cannot be declared litteraly; they have to be built using assignments. Lists are also a particular kind of container and can thus be manipulated using the container operators and commands.   * Litteral declaration: a set of expressions separated by commas, enclosed in square brackets, like 12, 14,  abc , self. An empty list is noted .   * Other declarations: lists can be build litteraly from a point, or a string, or any other element by using the list casting operator.   list (1) -> 1   list<int> myList <- 1,2,3,4;  myList2 => 3  Top of the page  ### map   * Definition: a composite datatype holding an ordered collection of pairs (a key, and its associated value).   * Built-in attributes:     * keys (type = list): the list of all keys     * values (type = list): the list of all values     * pairs (type = list of pairs): the list of all pairs key::value   * Comments: maps are more or less equivalent to instances of Hashtable in Java (although they are backed up by a specific class).   * Remark: maps can contain values of any datatypes, including other maps or lists. Maps are also a particular kind of container and can thus be manipulated using the container operators and commands.   * Litteral declaration: a set of pair expressions separated by commas, enclosed in square brackets; each pair is represented by a key and a value sperarated by  :: . An example of map is agentA:: big , agentB:: small , agentC:: big . An empty map is noted .   * Other declarations: lists can be built litteraly from a point, or a string, or any other element by using the map casting operator.   map (1) -> 1::1 map ({1,5}) -> x::1, y::5    // empty map   Top of the page  ### matrix   * Definition: a composite datatype that represents either a two-dimension array (matrix) or a one-dimension array (vector), holding any type of data (including other matrices).   * Comments: Matrices are fixed-size structures that can be accessed by index (point for two-dimensions matrices, integer for vectors).   * Litteral declaration: Matrices cannot be defined literally. One-dimensions matrices can be built by using the matrix casting operator applied on a list. Two-dimensions matrices need to to be declared as variables first, before being filled.   //builds a one-dimension matrix, of size 5 matrix mat1 <- matrix (10, 20, 30, 40, 50); //  builds a two-dimensions matrix with 10 columns and 5 rows, where each cell is initialized to 0.0 matrix mat2 <- 0.0 as_matrix({10,5});  // builds a two-dimensions matrix with 2 columns and 3 rows, with initialized cells matrix mat3 <- matrix(c11,c12,c13,c21,c22,c23);   -> c11;c21 c12;c22 c13;c23  Top of the page  ### pair   * Definition: a datatype holding a key and its associated value.   * Built-in attributes:     * key (type = string): the key of the pair, i.e. the first element of the pair     * value (type = string): the value of the pair, i.e. the second element of the pair   * Remark: pairs are also a particular kind of container and can thus be manipulated using the container operators and commands.   * Litteral declaration: a pair is defined by a key and a value sperarated by  :: .   * Other declarations: a pair can also be built from:     * a point,     * a map (in this case the first element of the pair is the list of all the keys of the map and the second element is the list of all the values of the map),     * a list (in this case the two first element of the list are used to built the pair)   pair testPair <- key::56; pair testPairPoint <- {3,5};   // 3::5 pair testPairList2 <- 6,7,8; // 6::7 pair testPairMap <- 2::6,5::8,12::45;  // 12,5,2::45,8,6  Top of the page  ### path   * Definition: a datatype representing a path linking two agents or geometries in a graph.   * Built-in attributes:     * source (type = point): the source point, i.e. the first point of the path     * target (type = point): the target point, i.e. the last point of the path     * graph (type = graph): the current topology (in the case it is a spatial graph), null otherwise     * edges (type = list of agents/geometries) :  the edges of the graph composing the path     * vertices (type = list of agents/geometries) :  the vertices of the graph composing the path     * segments (type = list of geometries): the list of the geometries composing the path     * shape (type = geometry) : the global geometry of the path (polyline)   * Comments: the path created between two agents/geometries or locations will strongly depends on the topology in which it is created.   * Remark: a path is immutable, i.e. it can not be modified after it is created.   * Declaration: paths are very barely defined litterally. We can nevertheless use the path unary operator on a list of points to build a path. Operators dedicated to the computation of paths (such as path_to or path_between) are often used to build a path.      path({1,5},{2,9},{5,8}) // a path from {1,5} to {5,8} through {2,9}  geometry rect <- rectangle(5); geometry poly <- polygon({10,20},{11,21},{10,21},{11,22}); path pa <- rect path_to poly;  // built a path between rect and poly, in the topolopy      // of the current agent (i.e. a line in a& continuous topology,      // a path in a graph  in a graph topology )  a_topology path_between a_container_of_geometries // idem with an explicit topology and the possiblity     // to have more than 2 geometries     // (the path is then built incrementally)  path_between (a_graph, a_source, a_target) // idem with a the given graph as topology       Top of the page  ### point   * Definition: a datatype normally holding two positive float values. Represents the absolute coordinates of agents in the model.   * Built-in attributes:     * x (type = float): coordinate of the point on the x-axis     * y (type = float): coordinate of the point on the y-axis   * Comments: point coordinates should be positive, if a negative value is used in its declaration, the point is built with the absolute value.   * Remark: points are particular cases of geometries and containers. Thus they have also all the built-in attributes of both the geometry and the container datatypes and can be used with every kind of operator or command admitting geometry and container.   * Litteral declaration: two numbers, separated by a comma, enclosed in braces, like {12.3, 14.5}   * Other declarations: points can be built litteraly from a list, or from an integer or float value by using the point casting operator.   point (12,123.45) -> {12.0, 123.45}  point (2) -> {2.0, 2.0}  Top of the page  ### rgb   * Definition: a datatype that represents a color in the RGB space.   * Built-in attributes:     * red(type = int): the red component of the color     * green(type = int): the green component of the color     * blue(type = int): the blue component of the color     * darker(type = rgb): a new color that is a darker version of this color     * brighter(type = rgb): a new color that is a brighter version of this color   * Remark: rgbs are also a particular kind of container and can thus be manipulated using the container operators and commands.   * Litteral declaration: there exist lot of ways to declare a color. We use the rgb casting operator applied to:     * a string. The allowed color names are the constants defined in the Color Java class, i.e.: black, blue, cyan, darkGray, lightGray, gray, green, magenta, orange, pink, red, white, yellow.     * a list. The integer value associated to the three first elements of the list are used to define the three red (element 0 of the list), green (element 1 of the list) and blue (element 2 of the list) components of the color.     * a map. The red, green, blue compoenents take the value associated to the keys  r ,  g ,  b  in the map.     * an integer <- the decimal integer is translated into a hexadecimal <- OxRRGGBB. The red (resp. green, blue) component of the color take the value RR (resp. GG, BB) translated in decimal.     * Since GAMA 1.6.1, colors can be directly obtained like units, by using the ° or # symbol followed by the name in lowercase of one of the 147 CSS colors (see http://www.cssportal.com/css3-color-names/).   * Declaration:   rgb cssRed <- #red;   // Since 1.6.1 rgb testColor <- rgb( white );       // rgb 255,255,255 rgb test <- rgb(3,5,67);    // rgb 3,5,67 rgb te <- rgb(340); // rgb 0,1,84 rgb tete <- rgb(r::34, g::56, b::345); // rgb 34,56,255  Top of the page  ### species   * Definition: a generic datatype that represents a species   * Built-in attributes:     * topology (type=topology): the topology is which lives the population of agents   * Comments: this datatype is actually a  meta-type . It allows to manipulate (in a rather limited fashion, however) the species themselves as any other values.   * Litteral declaration: the name of a declared species is already a litteral declaration of species.   * Other declarations: the species casting operator, or its variant called species_of can be applied to an agent in order to get its species.  Top of the page  Species names as types  Once a species has been declared in a model, it automatically becomes a datatype. This means that :   * It can be used to declare variables, parameters or constants,   * It can be used as an operand to commands or operators that require species parameters,   * It can be used as a casting operator (with the same capabilities as the built-in type agent)  In the simple following example, we create a set of  humans  and initialize a random  friendship network  among them. See how the name of the species, human, is used in the create command, as an argument to the list casting operator, and as the type of the variable named friend.   global {     init {   create human number: 10;   ask human {      friend <- one_of (human - self);   }      } } entities {     species human {  human friend <- nil;     } }   Top of the page  ### topology   * Definition: a topology is basically on neighborhoods, distance,… structures in which agents evolves. It is the environment or the context in which all these values are computed. It also provides the access to the spatial index shared by all the agents. And it maintains a (eventually dynamic) link with the  environment  which is a geometrical border.   * Built-in attributes:     * places(type = container): the collection of places (geometry) defined by this topology.     * environment(type = geometry): the environment of this topology (i.e. the geometry that defines its boundaries)   * Comments: the attributes places depends on the kind of the considered topolopy.  For continuous topologies, it is a list with their environment. For discrete topologies, it can be any of the container supporting the inclusion of geometries (list, graph, map, matrix)   * Remark: There exist various kinds of topology: continuous topology and discrete topology (e.g. grid, graph…)   * Declaration: To create a topology, we can use the topology unary casting operator applied to:     * an agent: returns a continuous topology built from the agent s geometry     * a species name: returns the topology defined for this species population     * a geometry: returns a continuous topology built on this geometry     * a geometry container (list, map, shapefile): returns an half-discrete (with corresponding places), half-continuous topology (to compute distances…)     * a geometry matrix (i.e. a grid): returns a grid topology which computes specifically neighborhood and distances     * a geometry graph: returns a graph topology which computes specifically neighborhood and distances More complex topologies can also be built using dedicated operators, e.g. to decompose a geometry…  Top of the page  Defining custom types  Sometimes, besides the species of agents that compose the model, it can be necessary to declare custom datatypes. Species serve this purpose as well, and can be seen as  classes  that can help to instantiate simple  objects . In the following example, we declare a new kind of  object , bottle, that lacks the skills habitually associated with agents (moving, visible, etc.), but can nevertheless group together attributes and behaviors within the same closure. The following example demonstrates how to create the species:   species bottle {     float volume <- 0.0 max:1 min:0.0;     bool is_empty -> {volume = 0.0};     action fill {   volume <- 1.0;     } }   How to use this species to declare new bottles :   create bottle {     volume <- 0.5; }   And how to use bottles as any other agent in a species (a drinker owns a bottle; when he gets thirsty, it drinks a random quantity from it; when it is empty, it refills it):   species drinker {      ...     bottle my_bottle<- nil;     float quantity <- rnd (100) / 100;     bool thirsty <- false update: flip (0.1);     ...     action drink {   if condition: ! bottle.is_empty {     bottle.volume <-bottle.volume - quantity;     thirsty <- false;   }     }     ...     init { create bottle return: created_bottle;     volume <- 0.5; } my_bottle <- first(created_bottle);     }     ...     reflex filling_bottle when: bottle.is_empty {   ask  my_bottle {     do fill;   }     }     ...     reflex drinking when: thirsty {   do drink;     } }  Top of the page ","url":"wiki/DataTypes.md"},{"id":"wiki/ExperimentBuiltIn.md","title":" The 'experiment' built-in species (Under Construction)","content":"The  experiment  built-in species (Under Construction)  As described in the presentation of GAML, any experiment attached to a model is a species (introduced by the keyword experiment which directly or indirectly inherits from an abstract species called experiment itself.

With the exception of headless experiments, GAMA requires that models be manageable in the current workspace to be able to validate them and eventually experiment them.  There are many situations where a model needs to be imported by the user: someone sent it to him/her by mail, it has been attached to an issue report, it has been shared on the web or an SVN server, or it belongs to a previous workspace after the user has switched workspace. The instructions below apply equally to all these situations.  Since model files need to reside in a project to be managed by GAMA, it is usually preferable to import a whole project rather than individual files (unless, of course, the corresponding models are simple enough to not require any additional resources, in which case, the model file can be imported with no harm into an existing project). GAMA will then try to detect situations where a model file is imported alone and, if a corresponding project can be found (for instance, in the upper directories of this file), to import the project instead of the file. As the last resort, GAMA will import orphan model files into a generic project called  Unclassified Models  (which will be created if it does not exist yet).  Table of contents     Importing Models  The  Import…  Menu Command       Silent import       Drag n Drop / Copy-Paste Limitations The  Import…  Menu Command The simplest, safest and most secure way to import a project into the workspace is to use the built-in  Import…  menu command, available in the  File  menu or in the contextual menu of the Navigator.    When invoked, this command will open a dialog asking the user to choose the source of the importation. It can be a directory in the filesystem (in which GAMA will look for existing projects), a zip file, a SVN site, etc. It is safer in any case to choose  Existing Projects into Workspace .    Note that when invoked from the contextual menu,  Import…  will directly give access to a shortcut of this source in a submenu.    Both options will lead the user to a last dialog where he/she will be asked to:     Enter a location (or browse to a location) containing the GAMA project(s) to import   Choose among the list of available projects (computed by GAMA) the ones to effectively import   Indicate whether or not these projects need to be copied to or linked from the workspace (the latter is done by default)     Silent import Another (possibly simpler, but less controllable) way of importing projects and models is to either pass a path to a model when launching GAMA from the command line or to double-click on a model file (ending in .gaml) in the Explorer or Finder (depending on your OS).  If the file is not already part of an imported project in the current workspace, GAMA will:     silently import the project (by creating a link to it),   open an editor on the file selected.   This procedure may fail, however, if a project of the same name (but in a different location) already exists in the workspace, in which case GAMA will refuse to import the project (and hence, the file). The solution in this case is to rename the project to import (or to rename the existing project in the workspace).  Drag n Drop / Copy-Paste Limitations Currently, there is no way to drag and drop an entire project into GAMA Navigator (or to copy a project in the filesystem and paste it in the Navigator). Only individual model files, folders or resources can be moved this way (and they have to be dropped or pasted into existing projects).  This limitation might be removed some time in the future, however, allowing users to use the Navigator as a project drop or paste target, but it is not the case yet. ","url":"wiki/ImportingModels.md"},{"id":"wiki/NavigatingWorkspace.md","title":" Navigating in the Workspace","content":"Navigating in the Workspace  All the models that you edit or run using GAMA are accessible from a central location: the Navigator, which is always on the left-hand side of the main window and cannot be closed. This view presents the models currently present in (or linked from) your workspace.    Table of contents     Navigating in the Workspace  The Different Categories of Models   Models library Plugin models User models   Inspect Models       Moving Models Around       Closing and Deleting Projects The Different Categories of Models  In the Navigator, models are organized in three different categories: Models library, Plugin models, and User models. This organization is purely logical and does not reflect where the models are actually stored in the workspace (or elsewhere). Whatever their actual location, model files need to be stored in projects, which may contain also other files (called resources) necessary for the models to function. A project may of course contain several model files, especially if they are importing each other, if they represent different models on the same topic, or if they share the same resources.    Models library  This category represents the models that are shipped with each version of GAMA. They do not reside in the workspace, but are considered as linked from it. This link is established every time a new workspace is created. Their actual location is within a plugin (msi.gama.models) of the GAMA application. This category contains four main projects in GAMA 1.6.1, which are further refined in folders and sub-folders that contain model files and resources.    It may happen, in some occasions, that the library of models is not synchronized with the version of GAMA that uses your workspace. This is the case if you use different versions of GAMA to work with the same workspace. In that case, it is required that the library be manually updated. This can be done using the  Update library  item in the contextual menu.    To look up for a particular model in the library, users can use the  Search for file  menu item. A search dialog is then displayed, which allows to look for models by their title (for example, models containing  GIS  in the example below).     Plugin models  This category represents the models that are related to a specific plugin (additional or integrated by default). The corresponding plugin is shown between parenthesis.    For each projects, you can see the list of plugins needed, and a caption to show you if the plugin is actually installed in your GAMA version or not : green if the plugin is installed, red otherwise.  User models  This category regroups all the projects that have been created or imported in the workspace by the user. Each project is actually a folder that resides in the folder of the workspace (so they can be easily located from within the filesystem). Any modification (addition, removal of files…) made to them in the file system (or using another application) is immediately reflected in the Navigator and vice-versa.  Model files, although it is by no means mandatory, usually reside in a sub-folder of the project called  models .    Inspect Models  Each models is presented as a node in the navigation workspace, including Experiment buttons and/or Requires node and/or Uses node.  Experiment button : Experiment button are present if your model contains experiments (it is usually the case !). To run the corresponding experiment, just click on it. To learn more about running experiments, jump into this section. Require node : The node Require is present if your model uses some plugins (additional or integrated by default). Each plugin is listed in this node, with a green icon if the plugin is already installed in your GAMA, and a red one if it is not the case. If the plugin you want in not installed, an error will be raised in your model. Please read about how to install plugins to learn some more about it. Uses node : The node Uses is present if your model uses some external resources, and if the path to the resource is correct (if the path to the resource is not correct, the resource will not be displayed under Uses)      Moving Models Around Model files, as well as resources, or even complete projects, can be moved around between the  Models Library / Plugin Models  and  Users Models  categories, or within them, directly in the Navigator. Drag n drop operations are supported, as well as copy and paste. For example, the model  Life.gaml , present in the  Models Library , can perfectly be copied and then pasted in a project in the  Users Model . This local copy in the workspace can then be further edited by the user without altering the original one.    Closing and Deleting Projects Users can choose to get rid of old projects by either closing or deleting them. Closing a project means that it will still reside in the workspace (and be still visible, although a bit differently, in the Navigator) but its model(s) won t participate to the build process and won t be displayable until the project is opened again.     Deleting a project must be invoked when the user wants this project to not appear in the workspace anymore (unless, that is, it is imported again). Invoking this command will effectively make the workspace  forget  about this project, and this can be further doubled with a deletion of the projects resources and models from the filesystem.    ","url":"wiki/NavigatingWorkspace.md"},{"id":"wiki/ChangingWorkspace.md","title":" Changing Workspace","content":"Changing Workspace  It is possible, and actually common, to store different projects/models in different workspaces and to tell GAMA to switch between these workspaces. Doing so involves being able to create one or several new workspace locations (even if GAMA has been told to remember the current one) and being able to easily switch between them.  Table of contents     Changing Workspace  Switching to another Workspace       Cloning the Current Workspace Switching to another Workspace This process is similar to the choice of the workspace location when GAMA is launched for the first time. The only preliminary step is to invoke the appropriate command ( Switch Workspace ) from the  File  menu.    In the dialog that appears, the current workspace location should already be entered. Changing it to a new location (or choosing one in the file selector invoked by clicking on  Browse… ) and pressing  OK  will then either create a new workspace if none existed at that location or switch to this new workspace. Both operations will restart GAMA and set the new workspace location. To come back to the previous location, just repeat this step (the previous location is normally now accessible from the combo box).    Cloning the Current Workspace Another possibility, if you have models in your current workspace that you would like to keep in the new one (and that you do not want to import one by one after switching workspace), or if you change workspace because you suspect the current one is corrupted, or outdated, etc. but you still want to keep your models, is to clone the current workspace into a new (or existing) one.  Please note that cloning (as its name implies) is an operation that will make a copy of the files into a new workspace. So, if projects are stored in the current workspace, this will result in two different instances of the same projets/models with the same name in the two workspaces. However, for projects that are simply linked from the current workspace, only the link will be copied (which allows to have different workspaces  containing  the same project)  This can be done by entering the new workspace location and choosing  Clone current workspace  in the previous dialog instead of  Ok .    If the new location does not exist, GAMA will ask you to confirm the creation and cloning using a specific dialog box. Dismissing it will cancel the operation.    If the new location is already the location of an existing workspace, another confirmation dialog is produced. It is important to note that all projects in the target workspace will be erased and replaced by the projects in the current workspace if you proceed. Dismissing it will cancel the operation.    There are two cases where cloning is not accepted. The first one is when the user tries to clone the current workspace into itself (i.e. the new location is the same as the current location).    The second case is when the user tries to clone the current workspace into one of its subdirectories (which is not feasible).   ","url":"wiki/ChangingWorkspace.md"},{"id":"wiki/MenusAndCommands.md","title":" Menus and Commands","content":"Menus and Commands  The simulation perspective adds on the user interface a number of new menus and commands (i.e. buttons) that are specific to experiment-related tasks.  Table of contents     Menus and Commands  Experiment Menu       Agents Menu       General Toolbar Experiment Menu A menu, called  Experiment , allows to control the current experiment. It shares some of its commands with the general toolbar (see below).       Run/Pause: allows to run or pause the experiment depending on its current state.   Step by Step: runs the experiment for one cycle and pauses it after.   Reload: stops the current experiment, deletes its contents, and reloads it, taking into account the parameters values that might have been changed by the user.   Stop at first error: if checked, the current experiment will stop running when an error is issued. The default value can be configured in the preferences.   Treat warnings as errors: if checked, a warning will be considered as an error (and if the previous item is checked, will stop the experiment). The default value can be configured in the preferences.   Display warnings and errors: if checked, displays the errors and warnings issued by the experiment. If not, do not display them. The default value can be configured in the preferences.   Force interrupt: forces the experiment to stop, whatever it is currently doing, purges the memory from it, and switches to the modeling perspective. Use this command with caution, as it can have undesirable effects depending on the state of the experiment (for example, if it is reading files, or outputting data, etc.).   Agents Menu  A second menu is added in the simulation perspective:  Agents . This menu allows for an easy access to the different agents that populate an experiment.    This hierarchical menu is always organized in the same way, whatever the experiment being run. A first level is dedicated to the current simulation agent: it allows to browse its population or to inspect the simulation agent itself. Browsing the population will give access to the current experiment agent (the  host  of this population). A second level lists the  micro-populations  present in the simulation agent. And the third level will give access to each individual agent in these populations. This organization is of course recursive: if these agents are themselves hosts of micro-populations, they will be displayed in their individual menu.    Each agent, when selected, will reveal a similar individual menu. This menu will contain a set of predefined actions, the commands defined by the user for this species, if any, and then the micro-populations hosted by this agent, if any. Agents (like the instances of  ant  below) that do not host other agents and whose species has no user commands will have a  simple  individual menu.    These are the 4 actions that will be there most of the time:     Inspect: open an inspector on this agent.   Highlight: makes this agent the current  highlighted  agent, forcing it to appear  highlighted  in all the displays that might have been defined.   Focus: this option is not accessible if no displays are defined. Makes the current display zoom on the selected agent (if it is displayed) so that it occupies the whole view.   Kill: destroys the selected agent and disposes of it. Use this command with caution, as it can have undesirable effects if the agent is currently executing its behavior.   If an agent hosts other agents (it is the case in multi-level architecture), you can access to the micro-population quite easily:    If user commands are defined for a species (for example in the existing model Features/Driving Skill/Road Traffic simple (City)), their individual menu will look like the following:    General Toolbar  The last piece of user interface specific to the Simulation Perspective is a toolbar, which contains controls and information displays related to the current experiment.  This toolbar is voluntarily minimalist, with three buttons already present in the experiment menu (namely,  Play/Pause ,  Step by Step  and  Reload ), which don t need to be detailed here, and two new controls ( Experiment status  and  Cycle Delay ), which are explained below.    While opening an experiment, the status will display some information about what s going on. For instance, that GAMA is busy instantiating the agents, or opening the displays.      The orange color usually means that, although the experiment is not ready, things are progressing without problems (a red color message is an indication that something went wrong). When the loading of the experiment is finished, GAMA displays the message  Simulation ready  on a green background. If the user runs the simulation, the status changes and displays the number of cycles already elapsed in the simulation currently managed by the experiment.    Hovering over the status produces a more accurate information about the internal clock of the simulation.    From top to bottom of this hover, we find the number of cycles elapsed, the simulated time already elapsed (in the example above, one cycle lasts one second of simulated time), the duration of cycle in milliseconds, the average duration of one cycle (computed over the number of cycles elapsed), and the total duration, so far, of the simulation (still in milliseconds).  Although these durations are entirely dependent on the speed of the simulation engine (and, of course, the number of agents, their behaviors, etc.), there is a way to control it partially with the second control, which allows the user to force a minimal duration (in milliseconds) for a cycle, from 0 (its initial position) to 1000. Note that this minimal duration (or delay) will remain the same for the subsequent reloads of the experiment.    In case it is necessary to have more than 1s of delay, it has to be defined, instead, as an attribute of the experiment.

Table of contents     Inspectors and monitors  Agent Browser       Agent Inspector       Monitor Agent Browser The species browser provides informations about all or a selection of agents of a species.  The agent browser is available through the Agents menu or by right clicking on a display (screenshots from the ).      It displays in a table all the values of the agent variables of the considered species; each line corresponding to an agent. The list of attributes is displayed on the left side of the view, and you can select the attributes you want to be displayed, simply by clicking on it (Ctrl + Click for multi-selection).    By clicking on the right mouse button on a line, it is possible to do some action for the corresponding agent.  Agent Inspector The agent inspector provides information about one specific agent. It also allows to change the values of its variables during the simulation. The agent inspector is available from the Agents menu, by right_clicking on a display, in the species inspector or when inspecting another agent.    It is possible to «highlight» the selected agent.    To change the color of the highlighted agent, go to Preferences/Display.    Monitor Monitors allow to follow the value of a GAML expression. For instance the following monitor allow to follow the number of infected people agents during the simulation. The monitor is updated at each simulation step.    It is possible to define a monitor inside a model (see this page). It is also possible to define a monitor through the graphical interface.  To define a monitor, first choose Add Monitor in the Views menu (or by clicking on the icon in the Monitor view), then define the display legend and the expression to monitor.    In the following example, we defined a monitor with the legend  Number initial of preys  and that has for value the global variable  nb_preys_init .    The expression should be written with the GAML language. See this page for more details about the GAML language.

Switching perspectives is easy. The small button in the top-left corner of the window allows to switch back and forth the two perspectives.    The actual contents of the simulation perspective will depend on the experiment being run and the outputs it defines. The next sections will present the most common ones (inspectors, monitors and displays), as well as the views that are not defined in outputs, like the Parameters or Errors view.

Each display provides several buttons to manipulate the display (from left to right):   * Show/hide side bar,   * Show/hide overlay,   * Browse through all displayed agents: open a context menu to inspect agents,   * Update every X step: configure the refresh frequence of the display,   * Pause the-display: when pressed, the display will not be displayed anymore, the simulation is still running,   * Synchronize the display and the execution of the model,   * Zoom in,   * Zoom to fit view,   * Zoom out,   * Take a snapshot: take a snapshot saved as a png image in the snapshots folder of the models folder.  The Show/Hide side bar button opens a side panel in the display allowing the modeler to configure:   * Properties of the display: background and highlight color, display the scale bar   * For each layer, we can configure visibility, transparency, position and size of the layer.

Table of contents     Launching Experiments from the User Interface  From an Editor       From the Navigator       Running Experiments Automatically       Running Several Simulations From an Editor As already mentioned on this page, GAML editors will provide the easiest way to launch experiments. Whenever a model that contains the definition of experiments is validated, these experiments will appear as distinct buttons, in the order in which they are defined in the file, in the header ribbon above the text. Simply clicking one of these buttons launches the corresponding experiment.    For each of those launching buttons, you can see 2 different pictograms, showing the type of experiment. An experiment can either be a GUI Experiment or a Batch Experiment.    From the Navigator You can also launch your experiments from the navigator, by expanding a model and double clicking on one of the experiments available (The number of experiments for each model is visible also in the navigator). As for the editor, the two types of experimentations (gui and batch) are differentiated by a pictogram.    Running Experiments Automatically Once an experiment has been launched (unless it is run in headless mode, of course), it normally displays its views and waits from an input from the user, usually a click on the  Run  or  Step  buttons (see here).  It is however possible to make experiments run directly once launched, without requiring any intervention from the user.  To install this feature, open the preferences of GAMA. On the first tab, simply check  Auto-run experiments when they are launched  (which is unchecked by default) and hit  OK  to dismiss the dialog. Next time you ll launch an experiment, it will run automatically (this option also applies to experiments launched from the command line).    Running Several Simulations  It is possible in GAMA to run several simulations. Each simulation will be launched with the same seed (which means that if the parameters are the same, then the result will be exactly the same). All those simulations are synchronized in the same cycle.  To run several experiments, you have to write it directly in your model.   ","url":"wiki/LaunchingExperiments.md"},{"id":"wiki/ErrorsView.md","title":" Errors View","content":"Errors View  Whenever a runtime error, or a warning, is issued by the currently running experiment, a view called  Errors  is opened automatically. This view provides, together with the error/warning itself, some contextual information about who raised the error (i.e. which agent(s)) and where (i.e. in which portion of the model code). As with other  status  in GAMA, errors will appear in red color and warnings in orange.  Since an error appearing in the code is likely to be raised by several agents at once, GAMA groups similar errors together, simply indicating which agent(s) raised them. Note that, unless the error is raised by the experiment agent itself, its message will indicate that at least 2 agents raised it: the original agent and the experiment in which it is plunged.

When new features were developed, or when serious issues were fixed, the release you had on your disk, prior to GAMA 1.6.1, could not benefit from them. Since this version, however, GAMA has been enhanced to support a self_update mechanism, which allows to import from the GAMA update site additional plugins (offering new features) or updated versions of the plugins that constitute the core of GAMA.  Table of contents     Updating GAMA  Manual Update       Automatic Update Manual Update To activate this feature, you have to invoke the  Check for Updates  or  Install New Software…  menu commands in the  Help  menu.  The first one will only check if the existing plugins have any updates available, while the second will, in addition, scan the update site to detect any new plugins that might be added to the current installation.    In general, it is preferable to use the second command, as more options (including that of desinstalling some plugins) are provided. Once invoked, it makes the following dialog appear:    GAMA expects the user to enter a so-called update site. You can copy and paste the following line (or choose it from the drop-down menu as this address is built inside GAMA):  http://updates.gama-platform.org   GAMA will then scan the entire update site, looking both for new plugins (the example below) and updates to existing plugins. The list available in your installation will, of course, be different from the one displayed here.    Choose the ones you want to install (or update) and click  Next… . A summary page will appear, indicating which plugins will actually be installed (since some plugins might require additional plugins to run properly), followed by a license page that you have to accept. GAMA will then proceed to the installation (that can be canceled any time) of the plugins chosen.  During the course of the installation, you might receive the following warning, that you can dismiss by clicking  OK .    Once the plugins are installed, GAMA will ask you whether you want to restart or not. It is always safer to do so, so select  Yes  and let it close by itself, register the new plugins and restart.    Automatic Update GAMA offers a mechanism to monitor the availability of updates to the plugins already installed. To install this feature, open the preferences of GAMA and choose the button  Advanced… , which gives access to additional preferences.    In the dialog that appears, navigate to  Install/Update > Automatic Updates . Then, enable the option using the check-box on the top of the dialog and choose the best settings for your workflow. Clicking on  OK  will save these preferences and dismiss the dialog.    From now on, GAMA will continuously support you in having an up-to-date version of the platform, provided you accept the updates. ","url":"wiki/Updating.md"},{"id":"wiki/InstallingPlugins.md","title":" Installing Plugins","content":"Installing Plugins  Besides the plugins delivered by the developers of the GAMA platform, which can be installed and updated as explained here, there are a number of additional plugins that can be installed to add new functionalities to GAMA or enhance the existing ones. GAMA being based on Eclipse, a number of plugins developed for Eclipse are then available (a complete listing of Eclipse plugins can be found in the so-called Eclipse MarketPlace).  There are, however, three important restrictions:     The current version of GAMA is based on Eclipse Juno (version number 3.8.2), which excludes de facto all the plugins targeting solely the 4.3 (Kepler) or 4.4 (Luna) versions of Eclipse. These will refuse to install anyway.   The Eclipse foundations in GAMA are only a subset of the complete Eclipse platform, and a number of libraries or frameworks (for example the Java Development Toolkit) are not (and will never be) installed in GAMA. So plugins relying on their existence will refuse to install as well.   Some components of GAMA rely on a specific version of other plugins and will refuse to work with other versions, essentially because their compatibility will not be ensured anymore. For instance, the parser and validator of the GAML language in GAMA 1.6.1 require XText v. 2.4.1 to be installed (and neither XText 2.5.4 nor XText 2.3 will satisfy this dependency).   With these restrictions in mind, it is however possible to install interesting additional plugins. We propose here a list of some of these plugins (known to work with GAMA), but feel free to either add a comment if you have tested plugins not listed here or create an issue if a plugin does not work, in order for us to see what the requirements to make it work are and how we can satisfy them (or not) in GAMA.  Table of contents     Installing Plugins  Installation       Selected Plugins   Overview Git CKEditor (#ckeditor) Startexplorer Pathtools CSV Edit Quickimage       Installation Installing new plugins is a process identical to the one described when updating GAMA, with one exception: the update site to enter is normally provided by the vendor of the additional plugin and must be entered instead of GAMA s one in the dialog. Let us suppose, for instance, that we want to install a RSS feed reader available on this site. An excerpt from the page reads that :     All plugins are installed with the standard update manager of Eclipse. It will guide you through the installation process and also eases keeping your plugins up-to-date. Just add the update site: http://www.junginger.biz/eclipse/   So we just have to follow these instructions, which leads us to the following dialog, in which we select  RSS view  and click  Next .    The initial dialog is followed by two other ones, a first to report that the plugin satisfies all the dependencies, a second to ask the user to accept the license agreement.  ||| |—|—|  Once we dismiss the warning that the plugin is not signed and accept to restart GAMA, we can test the new plugin by going to the  Views  menu.    The new RSS view is available in the list of views that can be displayed in GAMA.    And we can enjoy (after setting some preferences available in its local menu) monitoring the Issues of GAMA from within GAMA itself !    Selected Plugins In addition to the RSS reader described above, below is a list of plugins that have been tested to work with GAMA. There are many others so take the time to explore them !  Overview    A very useful plugin for working with large model files. It renders an overview of the file in a separate view (with a user selectable font size), allowing to know where the edition takes place, but also to navigate very quickly and efficiently to different places in the model.

Update site: http://kosz.bitbucket.org/eclipse-ckeditor/update-site   Startexplorer    A nice utility that allows the user to select files, folders or projects in the Navigator and open them in the filesystem (either the UI Explorer, Finder, whatever, or in a terminal).   Update site: http://basti1302.github.com/startexplorer/update/     Pathtools    Same purpose as StartExplorer, but much more complete, and additionally offers the possibility to add new commands to handle files (open them in specific editors, execute external programs on them, etc.).

You first need to determine which version to use (it depends on your computer, which may, or not, support 64 bits instructions, but also on the version of Java already installed, as the number of bits of the two versions must match).  You can then download the right version from the Downloads page, expand the zip file wherever you want on your machine, and launch GAMA.  Table of contents     Installation  System Requirements       Installation of Java   On MacOS X On Windows On Ubuntu & Linux       System Requirements  GAMA 1.7/1.8 requires that Java 1.8 be installed on your machine, approximately 200MB of disk space and a minimum of 4GB of RAM (to increase the portion of memory usable by GAMA, please refer to these instructions). Please note that GAMA is not considered as compatible with Java 1.9 and Java 1.10 as it has not been tested under these environments.  MacOS  In some cases,  Archive utility.app  in MacOS may damage the files when extracting them from the zip or tar.gz archive files. This problem manifests itself by a dialog opening and explaining that the application is damaged and cannot be launched (see Issue 2082 and also this thread. In that case, to expand the files, consider using a different utility, like the free Stuffit Expander or directly from the command line.  MacOS Sierra has introduced a series of issues linked to the so-called  quarantine  mode (where applications downloaded from Internet prevent to use and update their internal components, such as the models of the library or the self-updating of the application). See this page for background information. To be certain that Gama will work, and until we find an easier solution, the installation should follow these steps:     Download the GAMA zip file   Unzip it (possibly with another archive utility, see above)   Copy and paste Gama in the Applications folder   Launch Terminal.app   Type cd /Applications and hit return.   Type xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine Gama.app/ and hit return to remove the quarantine attribute   From now on, Gama should be fully functional.  Installation of Java  On all environments, the recommended Java Virtual Machine under which GAMA has been tested is the one distributed by Oracle (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).  Please make sure to install the JDK (Java Development Kit) and not the JRE (Java Runtime Environment). GAMA may work with the standard JRE, although it will be slower and may even crash (esp. under MacOS X).  On MacOS The latest version of GAMA requires a JVM (or JDK or JRE) compatible with Java 1.8 to run.  Note for GAMA 1.6.1 users: if you plan to keep a copy of GAMA 1.6.1, you will need to have both Java 1.6 (distributed by Apple) and Java 1.8 (distributed by Oracle) installed at the same time. Because of this bug in SWT (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=374199), GAMA 1.6.1 will not run correctly under Java 1.8 (all the displays will appear empty). To install the JDK 1.6 distributed by Apple, follow the instructions here : http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572. Alternatively, you might want to go to https://developer.apple.com/downloads and, after a free registration step if you re not an Apple Developer, get the complete JDK from the list of downloads.  On Windows Please notice that, by default, Internet Explorer and Chrome browsers will download a 32 bits version of the JRE. Running GAMA 32 bits for Windows is ok, but you may want to download the latest JDK instead, in order to both improve the performances of the simulator and be able to run GAMA 64 bits.     To download the appropriate java version, follow this link: http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp   Execute the downloaded file   You can check that a Java\\jre8 folder has been installed at the location C:\\Program Files\\   In order for Java to be found by Windows, you may have to modify environment variables:     Go to the Control Panel   In the new window, go to System   On the left, click on Advanced System parameters   In the bottom, click on Environment Variables   In System Variables, choose to modify the Path variable   At the end, add ;C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre8\\bin (or jre8\\bin)   On Ubuntu & Linux  To have a complete overview of java management on Ubuntu, have a look at:     Ubuntu Java documentation   for French speaking users: http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/java#installations_alternatives   Basically, you need to do:  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer    You can then switch between java version using:  sudo update-alternatives --config java   See the troubleshooting page for more information on workaround for problems on Unbuntu.

For example (if you are in the directory where the  Gama  executable is present):   export UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 ./Gama   No fix can be provided from the GAMA side for the moment.  On Windows No common trouble…  On MacOS X  Workaround in case of glitches in the UI  The only problems reported so far on MacOS X (from Lion to Yosemite) concern visual glitches in the UI and problems with displays, either not showing or crashing the JVM. Most (all ?) of these problems are usually related to the fact that GAMA does not run under the correct version of Java Virtual Machine. In that case, follow these instructions to install the correct version.  Workaround in case of corrupted icons in menus under El Capitan  For some particular configurations (in particular some particular graphic cards), the icons of the menus (e.g. Edit menu) may be corrupted. This bug is documented for all RCP products under El Capitan. See these references: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=479590 https://trac.filezilla-project.org/ticket/10669  These is nothing we can do now except using the workaround that consists in switching the language of the OS to English (in System Preferences, Language & Region).  Memory problems The most common causes of problems when running GAMA are memory problems. Depending on your activities, on the size of the models you are editing, on the size of the experiments you are running, etc., you have a chance to require more memory than what is currently allocated to GAMA. A typical GAMA installation  will need between 40 and 200MB of memory to run  normally  and launch small models. Memory problems are easy to detect: on the bottom right corner of its window, GAMA will always display the status of the current memory. The first number represents the memory currently used (in MB), the second (always larger) the memory currently allocated by the JVM. And the little trash icon allows to  garbage collect  the memory still used by agents that are not used anymore (if any). If GAMA appears to hang or crash and if you can see that the two numbers are very close, it means that the memory required by GAMA exceeds the memory allocated.    There are two ways to circumvent this problem: the first one is to increase the memory allocated to GAMA by the Java Virtual Machine. The second, detailed on this page is to try to optimize your models to reduce their memory footprint at runtime. To increase the memory allocated, first locate the file called Gama.ini. On Windows and Ubuntu, it is located next to the executable. On MacOS X, you have to right-click on Gama.app, choose  Display Package Contents… , and you will find Gama.ini in Contents/MacOS. This file typically looks like the following (some options/keywords may vary depending on the system), and we are interested in two JVM arguments:    -Xms supplies the minimal amount of memory the JVM should allocate to GAMA, -Xmx the maximal amount. By changing these values (esp. the second one, of course, for example to 4096M, or 4g), saving the file and relaunching GAMA, you can probably solve your problem. Note that 32 bits versions of GAMA will not accept to run with a value of -Xmx greater than 1500M. See here for additional information on these two options.  Submitting an Issue If you think you have found a new bug/issue in GAMA, it is time to create an issue report here ! Alternatively, you can click the Issues tab on the project site, search if a similar problem has already been reported (and, maybe, solved) and, if not, enter a new issue with as much information as possible:   * A complete description of the problem and how it occurred.   * The GAMA model or code you are having trouble with. If possible, attach a complete model.   * Screenshots or other files that help describe the issue.  Two files may be particularly interesting to attach to your issue: the configuration details and the error log. Both can be obtained quite easily from within GAMA itself in a few steps. First, click the  About GAMA…  menu item (under the  Gama  menu on MacOS X,  Help  menu on Linux & Windows)  In the dialog that appears, you will find a button called  Installation Details .    Click this button and a new dialog appears with several tabs.    To provide a complete information about the status of your system at the time of the error, you can  (1) copy and paste the text found in the tab  Configuration  into your issue. Although, it is preferable to attach it as a text file (using textEdit, Notepad or Emacs e.g.) as it may be too long for the comment section of the issue form.  (2) click the  View error log  button, which will bring you to the location, in your file system, of a file called  log , which you can then attach to your issue as well.   ","url":"wiki/Troubleshooting.md"},{"id":"wiki/Launching.md","title":" Launching GAMA","content":"Launching GAMA  Running GAMA for the first time requires that you launch the application (Gama.app on MacOS X, Gama.exe on Windows, Gama on Linux, located in the folder called Gama once you have unzipped the archive). Other folders and files are present here, but you don t have to care about them for the moment. In case you are unable to launch the application, of if error messages appear, please refer to the installation or troubleshooting instructions.  Table of contents     Launching GAMA  Launching the Application       Choosing a Workspace       Welcome Page Launching the Application  Note that GAMA can also be launched in two different other ways:     In a so-called headless mode (i.e. without user interface, from the command line, in order to conduct experiments or to be run remotely). Please refer to the corresponding instructions.   From the terminal, using a path to a model file and the name or number of an experiment, in order to allow running this experiment directly (note that the two arguments are optional: if the second is omitted, the file is imported in the workspace if not already present and opened in an editor; if both are omitted, GAMA is launched as usual):      Gama.app/Contents/MacOS/Gama path_to_a_model_file#experiment_name_or_number on MacOS X   Gama path_to_a_model_file#experiment_name_or_number on Linux   Gama.exe path_to_a_model_file#experiment_name_or_number on Windows     Choosing a Workspace Past the splash screen, GAMA will ask you to choose a workspace in which to store your models and their associated data and settings. The workspace can be any folder in your filesystem on which you have read/write privileges. If you want GAMA to remember your choice next time you run it (it can be handy if you run Gama from the command line), simply check the corresponding option. If this dialog does not show up when launching GAMA, it probably means that you inherit from an older workspace used with GAMA 1.6 or 1.5.1 (and still  remembered ). In that case, a warning will be produced to indicate that the models library is out of date, offering you the possibility to create a new workspace.    You can enter its address or browse your filesystem using the appropriate button. If the folder already exists, it will be reused (after a warning if it is not already a workspace). If not, it will be created. It is always a good idea, when you launch a new version of GAMA for the first time, to create a new workspace. You will then, later, be able to import your existing models into it. Failing to do so might lead to odd errors in the various validation processes.    Welcome Page As soon as the workspace is created, GAMA will open and you will be presented with its first window. GAMA is based on Eclipse and reuses most of its visual metaphors for organizing the work of the modeler. The main window is then composed of several parts, which can be views or editors, and are organized in a perspective. GAMA proposes 2 main perspectives: Modeling, dedicated to the creation of models, and Simulation, dedicated to their execution and exploration. Other perspectives are available if you use shared models.  The default perspective in which GAMA opens is Modeling. It is composed of a central area where GAML editors are displayed, which is surrounded by a Navigator view on the left-hand side of the window, an Outline view (linked with the open editor) and the Problems view, which indicates errors and warnings present in the models stored in the workspace.    In the absence of previously open models, GAMA will display a Welcome page (actually a web page), from which you can find links to the website, current documentation, tutorials, etc. This page can be kept open (for instance if you want to display the documentation when editing models) but it can also be safely closed (and reopened later from the  Views  menu).    From this point, you are now able to edit a new model, navigate in the models libraries, or import an existing model. ","url":"wiki/Launching.md"},{"id":"wiki/Headless.md","title":" Headless Mode","content":"Headless Mode  The aim of this feature is to be able to run one or multiple instances of GAMA without any user interface, so that models and experiments can be launched on a grid or a cluster. Without GUI, the memory footprint, as well as the speed of the simulations, are usually greatly improved.  In this mode, GAMA can only be used to run experiments and that editing or managing models is not possible. In order to launch experiments and still benefit from a user interface (which can be used to prepare headless experiments), launch GAMA normally (see here) and refer to this page for instructions.  Table of contents     Headless Mode  Command   Shell Script Java Command   Experiment Input File   Heading Parameters Outputs   Output Directory       Simulation Output   Step Variable   Snapshot files Command  There are two ways to run a GAMA experiment in headless mode: using a dedicated shell script (recommended) or directly from the command line. These commands take 2 arguments: an experiment file and an output directory.  Shell Script It can be found in the headless directory located inside Gama. Its name is gama-headless.sh on MacOSX and Linux, and gama-headless.bat on Windows.    sh gama-headless.sh m/c/t/hpc/v $1 $2      with:  $1 input parameter file : an xml file determining experiment parameters and attended outputs       $2 output directory path : a directory which contains simulation results (numerical data and simulation snapshot)       options -m/c/t/hpc/v   -m memory : memory allocated to gama -c : console mode, the simulation description could be written with the stdin -t : tunneling mode, simulation description are read from the stdin, simulation results are printed out in stdout -hpc nb_of_cores : allocate a specific number of cores for the experiment plan -v : verbose mode. trace are displayed in the console       For example (using the provided sample), navigate in your terminal to the headless folder inside your GAMA root folder and type:    sh gama-headless.sh samples/predatorPrey.xml outputHeadLess   As specified in predatorPrey.xml, this command runs the prey - predator model for 1000 steps and record a screenshot of the main display every 5 steps.

","url":"wiki/Headless.md"},{"id":"wiki/ValidationOfModels.md","title":" Validation of Models","content":"Validation of Models  When editing a model, GAMA will continuously validate (i.e. compile) what the modeler is entering and indicate, with specific visual affordances, various information on the state of the model. This information ranges from documentation items to errors indications. We will review some of them in this section.  Table of contents     Validation of Models  Syntactic errors       Semantic errors       Semantic warnings       Semantic information       Semantic documentation       Changing the visual indicators       Errors in imported files       Cleaning models Syntactic errors These errors are produced when the modeler enters a sentence that has no meaning in the grammar of GAML (see the documentation of the language). It can either be a non-existing symbol (like  globals  (instead of global) in the example below), a wrong punctuation scheme, or any other construct that puts the parser in the incapacity of producing a correct syntax tree. These errors are extremely common when editing models (since incomplete keywords or sentences are continuously validated). GAMA will report them using several indicators: the icon of the file in the title of the editor will sport an error icon and the gutter of the editor (i.e. the vertical space beside the line numbers) will use error markers to report two or more errors: one on the statement defining the model, and one (or more) in the various places where the parser has failed to produce the syntax tree. In addition, the toolbar over the editor will turn red and indicate that errors have been detected.    Hovering over one of these markers indicates what went wrong during the syntactic validation. Note that these errors are sometimes difficult to interpret, since the parser might fail in places that are not precisely those where a wrong syntax is being used (it will usually fail after).    Semantic errors When syntactic errors are eliminated, the validation enters a so-called semantic phase, during which it ensures that what the modeler has written makes sense with respect to the various rules of the language. To understand the difference between the two phases, take a look at the following example.  This sentence below is syntactically correct:  species my_species parent: my_species;  But it is semantically incorrect because a species cannot be parent of itself. No syntactic errors will be reported here, but the validation will fail with a semantic error.    Semantic errors are reported in a way similar to syntactic errors, except that no marker are displayed beside the model statement. The compiler tries to report them as precisely as possible, underlining the places where they have been found and outputting hopefully meaningful error messages. In the example below, for instance, we use a wrong number of arguments for defining a square geometry. Although the sentence is syntactically correct, GAMA will nevertheless issue an error and prevent the model from being experimentable.    The message accompanying this error can be obtained by hovering over the error marker found in the gutter (multiple messages can actually be produced for a same error, see below).    While the editor is in a so-called dirty state (i.e. the model has not been saved), errors are only reported locally (in the editor itself). However, as soon as the user saves a model containing syntactic or semantic errors, they are  promoted  to become workspace errors, and, as such, indicated in other places: the file icon in the Navigator, and a new line in the Errors view.    Semantic warnings  The semantic validation phase does not only report errors. It also outputs various indicators that can help the modeler in verifying the correctness of his/her model. Among them are warnings. A warning is an indication that something is not completely right in the way the model is written, although it can probably be worked around by GAMA when the model will be executed. For instance, in the example below, we pass a string argument to the facet  number:  of the  create  statement. GAMA will emit a warning in such a case, indicating that  number:  expects an integer, and that the string passed will be casted to int when the model will be executed. Warnings are to be considered seriously, as they usually indicate some flaws in the logic of the model.    Hovering over the warning marker will allow the modeler to have access to the explanation and hopefully fix the cause of the warning.    Semantic information Besides warnings, another type of harmless feedback is produce by the semantic validation phase: information markers. They are used to indicate useful information to the modeler, for example that an attribute has been redefined in a sub-species, or that some operation will take place when running the model (for instance, the truncation of a float to an int). The visual affordance used in this case is voluntarily discrete (a small  i  in the editor s gutter).    As with the other types of markers, information markers unveil their messages when being hovered.    Semantic documentation The last type of output of the semantic validation phase consists in a complete documentation of the various elements present in the model, which the user can retrieve by hovering over the different symbols. Note that although the best effort is being made in producing a complete and consistent documentation, it may happen that some symbols do not produce anything. In that case, please report a new Issue here.    Changing the visual indicators The default visual indicators depicted in the examples above to report errors, warnings and information can be customized to be less (or more) intrusive. This can be done by choosing the  Preferences…  item of the editor contextual menu and navigating to  General > Editors > Text Editors > Annotations . There, you will find the various markers used, and you will be able to change how they are displayed in the editor s view. For instance, if you prefer to highlight errors in the text, you can change it here.    Which will result in the following visual feedback for errors:    Errors in imported files  Finally, even if your model has been cleansed of all errors, it may happen that it refuses to launch because it imports another model that cannot be compiled. In the following screenshot,  My First Model.gaml  imports  My Imported Model.gaml , which sports a syntactic error.    In such a case, the importing model refuses to compile (although it is itself valid) and to propose experiments. There are cases, however, where the same importation can work. Consider the following example, where, this time,  My Imported Model.gaml  sports a semantic error in the definition of the global  shape  attribute. Without further modifications, the use case is similar to the first one.    However, if  My First Model.gaml  happens to redefine the shape attribute (in global), it is now considered as valid. All the valid sections of  My Imported Model.gaml  are effectively imported, while the erroneous definition is superseded by the new one.    This process is described by the information marker next to the redefinition.    Cleaning models It may happen that the metadata that GAMA maintains about the different projects (which includes the various markers on files in the workspace, etc.) becomes corrupted from time to time. This especially happens if you frequently switch workspaces, but not only. In those (hopefully rare) cases, GAMA may report incorrect errors for perfectly legible files.  When such odd behaviors are detected, or if you want to regularly keep your metadata in a good shape, you can clean all your project, by clicking on the button  Clear and validate all projects  (in the syntax errors view).

Mark the occurrences  This third toggle is used to show occurrences when your cursor is pointing on one word.  Display colorization of code section  One particular option, shipped by default with GAMA, is the possibility to not only highlight the code of your model, but also its structure (complementing, in that sense, the Outline view). It is a slightly modified version of a plugin called EditBox, which can be activated by clicking on the  green square  icon in the toolbar.

With the left / right arrows, you can highlight the previous / next occurrence of the word. The two toggles just in the right side of the search field are used to constraint the results as  case sensitive  or  whole word . If you prefer the eclipse interface for the search engine, you can also access to the tool by taping Ctrl+F.  Previous / Next location  The two arrow shape buttons that are coming after are used to jump from the current location of your cursor to the last position, even if the last position was in an other file (and even if this file has been closed !).  Show outline  This last tool of this section is used to show the global architecture of your model, with explicit icons for each section. A search field is also available, if you want to search a specific section. By double clicking one line of the outline, you can jump directly to the chosen section. This feature can be useful if you have big model to manipulate.    Format tools in the editor    Some other tools are available in the toolbar to help for the indentation of the model:  Shift left / shift right  Those two first buttons are used to shift a line (or a group of lines) on the left or the right.

An error will be displayed if the project name already exists in the workspace, in which case you will have to change it.

You can then choose whether you want to use a template or not for producing the initial file, and you are invited to give this file a name. An error is displayed if this name already exists in this project. The name of the model, which is by default computed with respect to the name of the file, can be actually completely different (but it may not contain white spaces or punctuation characters). The name of the author, as well as the textual description of the model and the creation of an HTML documentation, are optional.    Status of models in editors  Once this dialog is filled and accepted, GAMA will display the new  empty  model.    Although GAML files are just plain text files, and can therefore be produced or modified in any text processor, using the dedicated GAML editor offers a number of advantages, among which the live display of errors and model statuses. A model can actually be in four different states, which are visually accessible above the editing area: Functional (orange color), Experimentable (green color), InError (red color), InImportedError_(yellow color). See the section on model compilation for more precise information about these statuses._  In its initial state, a model is always in the Functional state, which means it compiles without problems, but cannot be used to launch experiments. The InError state, depicted below, occurs when the file contains errors (syntactic or semantic ones).    While the file is not saved, these errors remain displayed in the editor and nowhere else. If you save the file, they are now considered as  workspace errors  and get displayed in the  Problems  view below the editor.    Reaching the Experimentable state requires that all errors are eliminated and that at least one experiment is defined in the model, which is the case now in our toy model. The experiment is immediately displayed as a button in the toolbar, and clicking on it will allow to launch this experiment on your model. See the section about running experiments for more information on this point.    Experiment buttons are updated in real-time to reflect what s in your code. If more than one experiment is defined, corresponding buttons will be displayed in addition to the first one.    Editor Preferences  Text editing in general, and especially in Eclipse-based editors, sports a number of options and preferences. You might want to turn off/on the numbering of the lines, change the fonts used, change the colors used to highlight the code, etc. All of these preferences are accessible from the  Preferences…  item of the editor contextual menu.    Explore the different items present there, keeping in mind that these preferences will apply to all the editors of GAMA and will be stored in your workspace.    Additional informations in the Editor    You can choose to display or not some informations in your Editor  One particular option, shipped by default with GAMA, is the possibility to not only highlight the code of your model, but also its structure (complementing, in that sense, the Outline view).

The Default theme of EditBox might not suit everyone s tastes, so the preferences allow to entirely customize how the  boxes  are displayed and how they can support the modeler in better understanding  where  it is in the code. The  themes  defined in this way are stored in the workspace, but can also be exported for reuse in other workspaces, or sharing them with other modelers.    Multiple editors GAMA inherits from Eclipse the possibility to entirely configure the placement of the views, editors, etc. This can be done by rearranging their position using the mouse (click and hold on an editor s title and move it around). In particular, you can have several editors side by side, which can be useful for viewing the documentation while coding a model.    Local history Among the various options present to work with models, which you are invited to try out and test at will, one, called Local history is particularly interesting and worth a small explanation. When you edit models, GAMA keeps in the background all the successive versions you save (the history duration is configurable in the preferences), whether or not you are using a versioning system like SVN or Git. This local history is accessible from different places in GAMA (the Navigator, the Views menu, etc.), including the contextual menu of the editor.    This command invokes the opening of a new view, which you can see on the figure below, and which lists the different versions of your file so far. You can then choose one and, right-clicking on it, either open it in a new editor, or compare it to your current version.    This allows you to precisely pinpoint the modifications brought to the file and, in case of problems, to revert them easily, or even revert the entire file to a previous version. Never lose your work again !    This short introduction to GAML editors is now over. You might want to take a look, now, at how the models you edit are parsed, validated and compiled, and how this information is accessible to the modeler.

See here for information about plug-ins and their installation.  The graphical editor plug-in is called Graphical_modeling and is directly available from GAMA update site https://gama-platform.googlecode.com/svn/update_site/*.    Note that the graphical editor is still under development. Updates of the plug-in will be add to the GAMA website. After installing the plug-in (and periodically), check for updates for this plug-in: in the  Help  menu, choose  Check for Updates  and install the proposed updates for the graphical modeling plug-in.  Creating a first model  A new diagram can be created in a new GAMA project. First, right click on a project, then select  New  on the contextual menu. In the New Wizard, select  GAMA -> Model Diagram , then  Next>    In the next Wizard dialog, select the type of diagram (Empty, Skeleton or Example) then the name of the file and the author.    Skeleton and Example diagram types allow to add to the diagram some basic features.  Status of models in editors  Similarly to GAML editor, the graphical editor proposes a live display of errors and model statuses. A graphical model can actually be in three different states, which are visually accessible above the editing area: Functional (orange color), Experimentable (green color) and InError (red color). See the section on model compilation for more precise information about these statuses.  In its initial state, a model is always in the Functional state, which means it compiles without problems, but cannot be used to launch experiments. The InError state occurs when the file contains errors (syntactic or semantic ones).  Reaching the Experimentable state requires that all errors are eliminated and that at least one experiment is defined in the model. The experiment is immediately displayed as a button in the toolbar, and clicking on it will allow to launch this experiment on your model.  Experiment buttons are updated in real-time to reflect what s in your code. If more than one experiment is defined, corresponding buttons will be displayed in addition to the first one.  Diagram definition framework  The following figure presents the editing framework:   Features  agents #### species    The species feature allows to define a species with a continuous topology. A species is always a micro-species of another species. The top level (macro-species of all species) is the world species.     source: a species (macro-species)   target: -      grid    The grid feature allows to define a species with a grid topology. A grid is always a micro-species of another species.     source: a species (macro-species)   target: -     Inheriting link The inheriting link feature allows to define an inheriting link between two species.     source: a species (parent)   target: a species (child)     world    When a model is created, a world species is always defined. It represent the global part of the model. The world species, which is unique, is the top level species. All other species are micro-species of the world species.    agent features  action   The action feature allows to define an action for a species.     source: a species (owner of the action)   target: -     reflex   The reflex feature allows to define a reflex for a species.     source: a species (owner of the reflex)   target: -     aspect   The aspect feature allows to define an aspect for a species.     source: a species (owner of the aspect)   target: -      ### experiment #### GUI experiment    The GUI Experiment feature allows to define a GUI experiment.     source: world species   target: -     display    The display feature allows to define a display.     source: GUI experiment   target: -       batch experiment    The Batch Experiment feature allows to define a Batch experiment.     source: world species   target: -   Pictogram color modification It is possible to change the color of a pictogram.   * Right click on a pictogram, then select the  Chance the color .  GAML Model generation It is possible to automatically generate a Gaml model from a diagram.   * Right click on the graphical framework (where the diagram is defined), then select the  Generate Gaml model .

After having successfully launched the program, the user has two fundamental concepts at its disposal: a workspace, which contains models or links to models organized like a hierarchy of files in a filesystem, and the workbench (aka, the main window), which contains the tools to create, modify and experiment these models.  Understanding how to navigate in the workspace is covered in another section and, for the purpose of this section, we just need to understand that it is organized in projects, which contain models and their associated data. Projects are further categorized, in GAMA, into three categories : Models Library (built-in models shipped with GAMA and automatically linked from the workspace), Shared Models, and User Models.

Experiments can be run in different ways.   1. The first, and most common way, consists in launching an experiment from the Modeling perspective, using the user interface proposed by the simulation perspective to run simulations.   1. The second way, detailed on this page, allows to automatically launch an experiment when opening GAMA, subsequently using the same user interface.   1. The last way, known as running headless experiments, does not make use of the user interface and allows to manipulate GAMA entirely from the command line.  All three ways are strictly equivalent in terms of computations (with the exception of the last one omitting all the computations necessary to render simulations on displays or in the UI). They simply differ by their usage:   1. The first one is heavily used when designing models or demonstrating several models.   1. The second is intended to be used when demonstrating or experimenting a single model.   1. The last one is useful when running large sets of simulations, especially over networks or grids of computers.

Errors: how to manage and consider simulation errors  Display Errors: whether errors should be displayed or not.       Number of errors to display: how many errors should be displayed at once       Display most recent first: errors will be sorted in the inverse chronological order if true.       Stop simulation at first error: if false, the simulations will display the errors and continue (or try to).       Treat warnings as errors: if true, no more distinction is made between warnings (which do not stop the simulation) and errors (which can potentially stop it.

Display       Properties: various properties of displays  Default display method: use either  Java2D  or  OpenGL  if nothing is specified in the declaration of a display.       Synchronize displays with simulations: if true, simulation cycles will wait for the displays to have finished their rendering before passing to the next cycle (this setting can be changed on an individual basis dynamically here).       Show display overlay: if true, the bottom overlay is visible when opening a display.       Show scale bar in overlay: if true, the scale bar is displayed in the bottom overlay.       Apply antialiasing: if true, displays are drawn using antialiasing, which is slower but renders a better quality of image and text (this setting can be changed on an individual basis dynamically here).

Path to RScript: the path to the RScript library (http://www.r-project.org) in the system. GIS Coordinate Reference Systems: settings about CRS to use when loading or saving GIS files  Let GAMA decide which CRS to use to project GIS data: if true, GAMA will decide which CRS, based on input, should be used to project GIS data. Default is false (i.e. only one CRS, entered below, is used to project data in the models)       …or use the following CRS (EPSG code): choose a CRS that will be applied to all GIS data when projected in the models. Please refer to http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/ for a list of EPSG codes.       When no .prj file or CRS is supplied, consider GIS data to be already projected: if true, GIS data that is not accompanied by a CRS information will be considered as projected using the above code.       …or use the following CRS (EPSG code): choose a CRS that will represent the default code for loading uninformed GIS data.       When no CRS is provided, save the GIS data with the current CRS: if true, saving GIS data will use the projected CRS unless a CRS is provided.       …or use the following CRS (EPSG code): otherwise, you might enter a CRS to use to save files. Advanced Preferences  The set of preferences described above are specific to GAMA. But there are other preferences or settings that are inherited from the Eclipse underpinnings of GAMA, which concern either the  core  of the platform (workspace, editors, updates, etc.) or plugins (like SVN, for instance) that are part of the distribution of GAMA.

Depending on what is installed, the second view that appears will contain a tree of options on the left and preference pages on the right. Contrary to the first set of preferences, please note that these preferences will be saved in the current workspace, which means that changing workspace will revert them to their default values.

Except when running in headless mode, GAMA cannot function without a valid workspace.  The workspace is organized in 3 categories, which are themselves organized into projects.  The projects present in the workspace can be either directly stored within it (as sub-directories), which is usually the case when the user creates a new project, or linked from it (so the workspace will only contain a link to the directory of the project, supposed to be somewhere in the filesystem or on the network). A same project can be linked from different workspaces.  GAMA models files are stored in these projects, which may contain also other files (called resources) necessary for the models to function. A project may of course contain several model files, especially if they are importing each other, if they represent different views on the same topic, or if they share the same resources.

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is the best-known example of a cellular automaton. The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input from humans. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.  The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are directly horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur: \\\\n\\  1.Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation. \\\\n\\  2.Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding. \\\\n\\  3.Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation. \\\\n\\  4.Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell. The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first(generation) is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed�births and deaths happen simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the one before).

Banos, N. Corson, C. Pivano, L. Rajaonarivo, P. Taillandier  The LWR model was proposed by Lighthill and Whitham (1955) and by Richards (1956). It describes the trafic at a global level considering the speed, concentration and flows without taking into account the individual behavior af vehicles. Speed, concentration and flow are the three components of the LWR model. This models reproduces flow of traffic and congestion in specific conditions (homogeneous traffic), going from one equilibrium state to another (see the fundamental diagramm of traffic, which gives flow according to concentration). In this model, a road is divided into sections and we arbitrarily give to the middle section a lower speed and critical concentration.  Code of the model :       model TraficGroup  global {  float road_size <- 10 #km ;       // Size of the road  geometry shape <- rectangle (road_size, 200 #m) ;  // The world is a rectangle with a length equals to the size of the road and a height of 200m   float time_step <- 1.0 ;        // Time step  int nb_sections <- 10 ;        // Number of sections of the road float section_size <- road_size / nb_sections ;  // Size of a section  float car_size <- 4 #m ;         // Size of a car float nb_max_cars_on_section <- section_size / car_size ; // Maximum number of cars on one section      init{            // Creation of the nb_sections sections which compose the road.            loop i from: 0 to: (nb_sections - 1){        create section with: shape:: line({i * section_size , 100},{(i +1) * section_size , 100});     }            // For each section, as we need to have information concerning the previous and the next one, we define which section is the previous and which is the next.      // The previous section is the one which last point corresponds to the first point of the actual section.       // The next section is the one which first point corresponds to the last point of the actual section.             ask section{       previous <- section first_with (last(each.shape.points) = first(self.shape.points)) ;       next <- section first_with (first(each.shape.points) = last(self.shape.points)) ;      }       // For each section, we define a critical concentration (see the fundamental diagram), a maximum speed, a concentration and a flow (which are = 0 at initialization).       // A fundamental relation about trafic gives : flow = concentration * speed.            ask section{       critical_concentration <- 125.0 ; //Kc    max_speed <- 50 #km/#h; // Vl    current_concentration <- 0.0 ;    current_flow <- current_concentration * max_speed ;    max_flow <- critical_concentration * max_speed ;       }                  // The concentration and flow ot first section are initialized.            ask section0{       current_concentration <- nb_max_cars_on_section ;    current_flow <- current_concentration * max_speed ;      }            // The middle section is supposed to have a different maximum speed and a different critical concentration so that we can observe congestion phenomenon.      // This middle section is green.            ask sectionint(nb_sections/2) {        critical_concentration <- 10.0 ;         max_flow <- critical_concentration * max_speed ;         max_speed <- 10 #km/#h;      color <- #green;      }  }   // To update flow and concentration at each time step in each section, we use an offer and a demand function.     // These functions define the welcome capacity (offer) and the emission capacity (demand) of a section.  reflex offer_function {      ask section {     if current_concentration <= critical_concentration {      offer <- max_flow ;     }     else {      offer <- max(0 , (- max_flow / critical_concentration) * current_concentration + 2 * max_flow );     }       } }  reflex demand_function {  ask section{     if current_concentration <= critical_concentration {       demand <- max(0 , ( max_flow / critical_concentration) * current_concentration) ;     }     else {       demand <- max_flow ;     }  } }  // The flow and concentration are then updated according to the offer and demand functions of the current section, but also of the next and previous ones.  // During a time step, the flow of a section take the minimum value between its demand and the offer of the next section. // The flow of the last section is equal to its demand.   reflex update_flow{  ask section  {   float next_offer <-  (self.next != nil) ?

Each player have an offensive and a defensive position, and a behavior associated. Each player of the defensive team can either search to catch the ball or mark an other player (offensive player) according to his defensive position. Each player of the offensive team can either run to its offensive place (when he does not have the ball), run with the balloon / pass the ball / try to score a goal (when he has the ball). By changing the different parameters, you can see the concequences in real time.

A of mobile agents - the ants - is placed on a grid. The grid itself contains cells of different colors. Each step, the agents move randomly.

The operators capture is used to capture an agent by a group and change its species as a species contained by the group and defined in the group species section. The operator release is used to release contained agents and change them into an other species. The experiment shows ball moving randomly, and following other balls. When they are close to each other, they generate a group of balls with its own behavior. A group of group agents generate a cloud in the same way.

Within this single application software, often referred to as a platform, users can undertake, without the need of additional third-parties softwares, most of the activities related to modeling and simulation, namely editing models and simulating, visualizing and exploring them using dedicated tools.  First-time users may however be intimidated by the apparent complexity of the platform, so this part of the documentation has been designed to ease their first contact with it, by clearly identifying tasks of interest to modelers and how they can be accomplished within GAMA.  It is accomplished by firstly providing some background about important notions found throughout the platform, especially those of workspace and projects and explaining how to organize and navigate through models. Then we take a look at the edition of models and its various tools and components (dedicated editors and related tools, of course, but also validators). Finally, we show how to run experiments on these models and what support the user interface can provide to users in this task.

At the end of the formation, each student (by groups of 2 or 3) had to present a model in a mini-projet. The purpose of this mii-project was to use a platform and to create a model related to their respective research topics. Here is an overview of the model that has been implemented with Gama. Some of those projects has been presenting in COMMISCO 2012  Projects  First year (promo2012) Siny  Ndoye - Quang Truong Chi Modelisation of the land use applied to the commune of My An-Ben Tre in the Delta Mekong.  Since 1999, Vietnam has transformed 380 000 ha of rice agriculture into aquaculture. It has different impact like the fall of the rice agriculture, forest destruction and demographic increase near aqua farm. The shrimp culture is responsible of the destruction of the mangrove swamp since the 90 s. The aim of this model was to study the impact of a government aid for rice producer on this problem.  Cedrigue Djiongo - Abdelkarim Ed-Darraz Modelisation of the different  land use in the forest.  The model study the dynamic of forest parcel over the time according to the activity of nomad paysans. The parcel can have different state such as primary forest, chromolaena forest, bush fallow, forest crop field or secondary forest).  Souleymane Sy - Nghi Huynh Quang Impact of the dynamic of the vegetation of the rain in west africa  West africa is one of the part of the world that faced the most climate variability during the second half of the 20th century. To understand the origin on the variability on the amount of rain Gama is used to study the impact of the vegetation dynamic on the rain using a retroactivity between vegetation and atmosphere  Hédia Zardi - Tran Thi Cam Giang Modelisation of the SEIR model by GAMA  Until today, many infectious diseases in the world such as measles, tuberculosis, dengue … still exist. These diseases are one of the main causes of infant mortality in most countries of Asis, Africa, etc. Therefore, we want to present these infectious diseases in the computer models, after we want to find the periods of diseases to provide positive solutions that allow us to turn them off.  Second year (promo2011)  Ahmed Tidjane Cisse - Arnaud Grignard Vector disease modélisation- Multi point of view approach and visualization.  Propose a meta-model applied to vector disease. Gama has been used to study the rift valley fever disease according to a meta-model previously defined. The idea is to define basic or macro behavior for host, environment and  infectious agent on which a vector is moving and then to implement those meta-agent for a specific vector disease (in this case the rift valey fever).  Third year (promo2010)  Moussa Gueye - Inès Hassoumi - Zineb Belarbi Impact of the dispersion of air pollutants: applied to the city of Tunis  This project study the impact of pollutants on the environment on the health. The goal is to identify where new urban zone can be created by taking in account the concentration of each pollutants in the city. The main interest of the model is the coupling of the data coming from numerical equation of the advection-diffusion process using finite element method and then include those results on a grid created in Gama on which the value of each pollutants is extrapolated.

An agent is created by line of the CSV file. It is also possible to read the different column of the file using the read operator: read (column_index) (start at 0)   read(1)   For example:  create people from: data_file.csv with: speed::read(0), age:: read(1);   It is also possible to specify that the CSV file has a header that can give the name of the different column using the header facet (boolean). It this case, it is possible to directly use this name to read the column value: read( attribute1 ).  For example:  create people from: data_file.csv with: speed::read(SPEED), age:: read(AGE) header: true;   Improving and simplifying the syntax of GAML New features:   * Possibility to define 3D points with the {x,y,z} syntax:  let pt type: point <- {2, 5, 3};  # Documenting and enhancing the command line version  summary One-sentence summary of this page.  The aim of this feature is to run models and experiments on a grid or a cluster without GUI and to take advantages of High Performance Computing. It promises efficient running by accelerating each simulation and experiment plan computing. The GUI is not loaded and managed. Several simulations could be run in parallel, at same time.  There is two ways to run a GAMA experiment in headless mode: using command-line launcher or Java command line. These commands take 2 arguments: an experiment file and an output directory.

For a grid:  grid cell width: 5 height: 5 neighbours: 8 torus: true    For the continuous environment:  environment bounds: {50,50} torus: true;   Be careful concerning toroidal continuous environment: the computation required by these environment is high, thus they should be used only when they are really necessary.  A demonstration of a continuous toroidal environment is given in the experimental model: testTorus-> continuous_torus.    Communication Skill Plugin-needed: msi.gaml.extensions.fipa  The communicating skill now re-works on GAMA 1.5. Sample toy models are found in  models/fipa .  Update of the Trust Skill to Gama 1.5  Hexgonal geometry and grid It is now possible to create a hexagon of with the given width and height (point) thanks to the operator hexagon({width, height})   hexagon({3,4})   In the same way, an operator has been defined in order to decomposed a geometry into a set of hexagons of a given a number of columns and rows. This operator returns a set of hexagons: geometry as_hexagonal_grid({nb_cols, nb_rows})   shape as_hexagonal_grid({50, 40})   At last, it is now possible to define a hexagonal grid. To do so, the neighbors should is set to 6. It is possible to use torus environment with hexagonal grid.   grid cell width: 20 height: 20 neighbours: 6 torus: true;     Using HSB color  Add HSB color to be able to iterate through colors and use it to represent qualitative data.  Example:  The association of the orientation of agents is enhanced by mapping the orientation of the agent to a hue.   color hsb_to_rgb (heading/360,1.0,1.0);   In the following example boids are represented by a triangle with the colors depending on their heading.   Multicore runner in Headless Mode Results: distribution of command-line version on multicore machine, integration with GAMA interface, visualisation of outputs.  Defining interaction in a model  One statement have been added to facilitate the proposal of serious game on which user could interact through a map.

If true, the developers might want to consider writing the example line (and its associated lines) using template variables (e.g. ${my_agent}).  @facet This facet describes a facet in a list of facets.  This annotation contains:   * name (String): the name of the facet. Must be unique within a symbol.   * type (set of int): the string values of the different types that can be taken by this facet.   * values (set of Strings, empty by default): the values that can be taken by this facet.

This annotation contains:   * name (String): a (human-understandable) string describing this type of files, suitable for use in composed operator names (e.g.  shape ,  image …). This name will be used to generate two operators: name+ _file  and  is +name. The first operator may have variants taking one or several arguments, depending on the @builder annotations present on the class_.   * extensions (set of Strings): an array of extensions (without the  .  delimiter) or an empty array if no specific extensions are associated to this type of files (e.g.  png , jpg , jpeg …). The list of file extensions allowed for this type of files. These extensions will be used to check the validity of the file path, but also to generate the correct type of file when a path is passed to the generic  file  operator.   * buffer_content (int, ITypeProvider.NONE by default): the type of the content of the buffer. Can be directly a type in IType or one of the constants declared in ITypeProvider (in which case, the content type is searched using this provider).   * buffer_index (int, ITypeProvider.NONE by default): the type of the index of the buffer.

Provides a way to tell where this symbol should be located in a model (i.e. what its parents should be). Either direct symbol names (in symbols) or generic symbol kinds can be used.  This annotation contains:   * symbols (set of Strings, empty by default): symbol names of the parents.   * kinds (set of int, empty by default): generic symbol kinds of the parents (see ISymbolKind.java for more details).  @operator This annotation represents an  operator  in GAML, and is used to define its name(s) as well as some meta-data that will be used during the validation process.  This annotation contains:   * value (set of Strings, empty by default): names of the operator.   * category (set of string, empty by default): categories to which the operator belong (for documentation purpose).   * iterator (boolean, false by default): true if this operator should be treated as an iterator (i.e.requires initializing the special variable  each  of WorldSkill within the method).   * can_be_const (boolean, false by default): if true: if the operands are constant, returns a constant value.   * content_type (int, ITypeProvider.NONE by default): the type of the content if the returned value is a container. Can be directly a type in IType or one of the constants declared in ITypeProvider (in which case, the content type is searched using this provider).   * index_type (int, ITypeProvider.NONE by default): the type of the index if the returned value is a container.

Should be an array of IType.XXX.   * type (int, ITypeProvider.NONE by default): the type of the expression if it cannot be determined at compile time (i.e. when the return type is  Object ). Can be directly a type in IType or one of the constants declared in ITypeProvider (in which case, the type is searched using this provider)..   * internal (boolean, false by default): returns whether this operator is for internal use only.    * doc (set of @doc, empty by default): the documentation attached to this operator.  @serializer It allows to declare a custom serializer for Symbols (statements, var declarations, species ,experiments, etc.). This serializer will be called instead of the standard serializer, superseding this last one. Serializers must be subclasses of the SymbolSerializer class.   * value (Class): the serializer class.  @setter This annotations is used to indicate that a method is to be used as a setter for a variable defined in the class. The variable must be defined on its own (in vars).  This annotation contains:   * value (String): the name of the variable for which the annotated method is to be considered as a setter.  @skill This annotations Allows to define a new skill (class grouping variables and actions that can be used by agents).

Example:   @species(value=animal skills={moving})   * internal (boolean, false by default): whether this species is for internal use only.   * doc (set of @doc, empty by default): the documentation attached to this operator.  @symbol This annotation represents a  statement  in GAML, and is used to define its name(s) as well as some meta-data that will be used during the validation process.  This annotation contains:   * name (set of string, empty by default): names of the statement.   * kind (int): the kind of the annotated symbol (see ISymbolKind.java for more details).   * with_scope (boolean, true by default): indicates if the statement (usually a sequence) defines its own scope. Otherwise, all the temporary variables defined in it are actually defined in the super-scope.   * with_sequence (boolean): indicates wether or not a sequence can or should follow the symbol denoted by this class.   * with_args (boolean, false by default): indicates wether or not the symbol denoted by this class will accept arguments.   * remote_context (boolean, false by default): indicates that the context of this statement is actually an hybrid context: although it will be executed in a remote context, any temporary variables declared in the enclosing scopes should be passed on as if the statement was executed in the current context.   * doc (set of @doc, empty by default): the documentation attached to this symbol.   * internal (boolean, false by default): returns whether this symbol is for internal use only.   * unique_in_context (boolean, false by default): Indicates that this statement must be unique in its super context (for example, only one return is allowed in the body of an action)..   * unique_name (boolean, false by default): Indicates that only one statement with the same name should be allowed in the same super context.  @type It provides information necessary to the processor to identify a type.  This annotation contains:   * name (String,    by default): a String representing the type name in GAML.   * id (int, 0 by default): the unique identifier for this type. User-added types can be chosen between IType.AVAILABLE_TYPE and IType.SPECIES_TYPE (exclusive) (cf. IType.java).   * wraps (tab of Class, null by default): the list of Java Classes this type is  wrapping  (i.e. representing). The first one is the one that will be used preferentially throughout GAMA. The other ones are to ensure compatibility, in operators, with compatible Java classes (for instance, List and GamaList).   * kind (int, ISymbolKind.Variable.REGULAR by default): the kind of Variable used to store this type. See ISymbolKind.Variable.   * internal (boolean, false by default): whether this type is for internal use only.   * doc (set of @doc, empty by default): the documentation associated to the facet.  @usage This replaces @special_cases and @examples, and unifies the doc for operators, statements and others. An @usage can also be used for defining a template for a GAML structure, and in that case requires the following to be defined:   * A name (attribute  name ), optional, but better   * A description (attribute  value ), optional   * A menu name (attribute  menu ), optional   * A hierarchical path within this menu (attribute  path ), optional   * A pattern (attribute  pattern  or concatenation of the @example present in  examples  that define  isPattern  as true)  This annotation contains:   * value (String): a String representing one usage of the keyword. Note that for usages aiming at defining templates, the description is displayed on a tooltip in the editor. The use of the path allows to remove unecessary explanations. For instance, instead of writing : description= This template illustrates the use of a complex form of the  create  statement, which reads agents from a shape file and uses the tabular data of the file to initialize their attributes , choose: name= Create agents from shapefile  menu=STATEMENT; path={ Create ,  Complex forms } description= Read agents from a shape file and initialze their attributes . If no description is provided, GAMA will try to grab it from the context where the template is defined (in the documentation, for example).   * menu (String,    by default): Define the top-level menu where this template should appear. Users are free to use other names than the provided constants if necessary (i.e.  My templates ). When no menu is defined, GAMA tries to guess it from the context where the template is defined.   * path (set of Strings, empty be default): The path indicates where to put this template in the menu. For instance, the following annotation:   menu = STATEMENT; path = { Control ,  If } will put the template in a menu called  If , within  Control , within the top menu  Statement . When no path is defined, GAMA will try to guess it from the context where the template is defined (i.e. keyword of the statement, etc.)   * name (String,    by default): The name of the template should be both concise (as it will appear in a menu) and precise (to remove ambiguities between templates).   * examples (set of @example, empty by default): An array of String representing some examples or use-cases about how to use this element, related to the particular usage above.   * pattern (String,    by default): Alternatively, the contents of the usage can be descried using a @pattern (rather than an array of @example). The formatting of this string depends entirely on the user (e.g. including \\n and   for indentation, for instance).  @validator It allows to declare a custom validator for Symbols (statements, var declarations, species ,experiments, etc.). This validator, if declared on subclasses of Symbol, will be called after the standard validation is done. The validator must be subclass of IDescriptionValidator.   * value (Class): the validator class.  @variable This annotation is used to describe a single variable or field.  This annotation contains:   * name (String): the name of the variable as it can be used in GAML.   * type (int): The textual representation of the type of the variable (see IType).   * of (int, 0 by default): The textual representation of the content type of the variable (see IType#defaultContentType()).   * index (int, 0 by default): The textual representation of the index type of the variable (see IType#defaultKeyType()).   * constant (boolean, false by default): returns whether or not this variable should be considered as non modifiable.   * init (String,    by default): the initial value of this variable as a String that will be interpreted by GAML.   * depend_on (set of Strings, empty by default): an array of String representing the names of the variables on which this variable depends (so that they are computed before).   * internal (boolean, false by default): return whether this var is for internal use only.   * doc (set of @doc, empty by default): the documentation associated to the variable.  @vars This annotation is used to describe a set of variables or fields.  This annotation contains:   * value (set of @var): an Array of var instances, each representing a variable.

The PDF file is produced from the wiki files.  In the wiki files, some are hand-written by the GAMA community and some others are generated automatically from the Java code and the associated java annotations.  The section summarizes: * how to generate this wiki files, * how to generate the PDF documentation, * how to generate the unit tests from the java annotations,  * how to add documentation in the java code.  Requirements  To generate automatically the documentation, the GAMA Git version is required. See Install Git version for more details.  Among all the GAMA plugins, the following ones are related to documentation generation: * msi.gama.processor: the java preprocessor is called during java compilation of the various plugins and extract information from the java code and the java annotations. For each plugin it produces the docGAMA.xml file in the gaml directory. * msi.gama.documentation: it contains all the java classes needed to gather all the docGAMA.xml files and generate wiki, pdf or unit test files.  In addition, the folder containing the wiki files is required. In the GitHub architecture, the wiki documentation is stored in a separate Git repository https://github.com/gama-platform/gama.wiki.git. A local clone of this repository should thus be created: 1. Open the Git perspective:   * Windows > Open Perspective > Other…   * Choose Git 2. Click on  Clone a Git repository    * In Source Git repository window:      * Fill in the URI label with: https://github.com/gama-platform/gama.wiki.git     * Other fields will be automatically filled in.   * In Branch Selection windows,      * check the master branch      * Next   * In Local Destination windows,     * Choose the directory in which the gama Git repository has been cloned     * Everything else should be unchecked      * Finish 3. In the Git perspective and the Git Repositories view, Right-Click on  Working Directory  inside the gama.wiki repository, and choose  Import projects    * In the Select a wizard to use for importing projects window:     *  Import existing projects  should be checked     *  Working Directory  should be selected   * In Import Projects window:     * Uncheck « Search for nested project »     * Check the project gama.wiki     * Finish 2. Go back to the Java perspective: a gama.wiki plugin should have been added.  In order to generate the PDF file from the wiki files, we use an external application named Pandoc. Follow the Pandoc installation instructions to install it. Specify the path to the pandoc folder in the file  Constants.java , in the static constant CMD_PANDOC :  yourAbsolutePathToPandoc/pandoc .  Note that Latex should be installed in order to be able to generate PDF files. Make sure you have already installed Miktex (for OS Windows and Mac). Specify the path to the miktex folder in the file  Constants.java , in the static constant CMD_PDFLATEX :  yourAbsolutePathToMiktex/pdflatex .  Configuration  The location where the files are generated (and other constants used by the generator) are defined in the file msi.gama.documentation/src/msi/gama/doc/util/Constants.java.  The use of Pandoc (path to the application and so on) is defined in the file msi.gama.documentation/src/msi/gama/doc/util/ConvertToPDF.java. This should be changed in the future…  Generated files location The generated files are (by default) generated in various locations depending on their type: * wiki files: they are generated in the plugin gama.wiki. * pdf file: they are generated in the plugin msi.gama.documentation, in the folder files/gen/pdf. * unit test files: they are generated in the plugin msi.gama.models, in the folder models/Tests.  Workflow to generate wiki files  The typical workflow to generate the wiki files is as follow: * Clean and Build all the GAMA projects, * Run the MainGenerateWiki.java file in the msi.gama.documentation, * The wiki files are generated in the gama.wiki plugin.  Workflow to generate PDF files  The typical workflow to generate the wiki files is as follow: * Clean and Build all the GAMA projects, * In the file mytemplate.tex, specify the absolute path to your  gama_style.tex  (it should be just next to this file) * Run the MainGeneratePDF.java file in the msi.gama.documentation, accepting all the packages install of latex, * The wiki files are generated in the msi.gama.documentation plugin.  Note that generating the PDF takes a lot of time. Please be patient !  If you want to update the file  gama_style.sty  (for syntax coloration), you have to turn the flag  generateGamaStyle  to  true  (and make sure the file  keywords.xml  is already generated).  Workflow to generate unit tests  The typical workflow to generate the wiki files is as follow: * Clean and Build all the GAMA projects, * Run the MainGenerateUnitTest.java file in the msi.gama.documentation, * The wiki files are generated in the msi.gama.models plugin.  Main internal steps     Clean and Build all the GAMA projects will create a docGAMA.xml file in the gaml directory of each plugin,   The MainGenerateXXX.java files then perform the following preparatory tasks:  they prepare the gen folder by deleting the existing folders and create all the folders that may contain intermediary generated folders       they merge all the docGAMA.xml files in a docGAMAglobal.xml file, created in the files/gen/java2xml folder. Only the plugins that are referred in the product files are merged. After these common main first steps, each generator (wiki, pdf or unit test) performs specific tasks.  Generate wiki files     The docGamaglobal.xml is parsed in order to generate 1 wiki file per kind of keyword:  operators,       statements,       skills,       architectures,       built-in species,       constants and units.       in addition an index wiki file containing all the GAML keywords is generated. One wiki file is generated for each extension plugin, i.e. plugin existing in the Eclipse workspace but not refered in the product.   Generate pdf files  The pdf generator uses the table of content (toc) file located in the files/input/toc folder (msi.gama.documetation plugin) to organize the wiki files in a pdf file.     MainGeneratePDF.java file parsers the toc file and create the associated PDF file using the wiki files associated to each element of the toc. The generation is tuned using files located in the files/input/pandocPDF folder.   Generate unit test files     MainGenerateUnitTest.java creates GAMA model files for each kind of keyword from the docGAMAglobal.xml file.   How to document  The documentation is generate from the Java code thanks to the Java additional processor, using mainly information from Java classes or methods and from the Java annotations. (see the list of all annotations for more details about annotations).  The @doc annotation  Most of the annotations can contain a @doc annotation, that can contain the main part of the documentation.  For example, the inter (inter) operator is commented using:   @doc(   value = the intersection of the two operands,   comment = both containers are transformed into sets (so without duplicated element, cf. remove_deplicates operator) before the set intersection is computed.,   usages = {     @usage(value = if an operand is a graph, it will be transformed into the set of its nodes),     @usage(value = if an operand is a map, it will be transformed into the set of its values, examples = {       @example(value = 1::2, 3::4, 5::6 inter 2,4, equals = 2,4),       @example(value = 1::2, 3::4, 5::6 inter 1,3, equals = ) }),     @usage(value = if an operand is a matrix, it will be transformed into the set of the lines, examples =       @example(value = matrix(1,2,3,4,5,4) inter 3,4, equals = 3,4)) },   examples = {      @example(value = 1,2,3,4,5,6 inter 2,4, equals = 2,4),     @example(value = 1,2,3,4,5,6 inter 0,8, equals = ) },   see = { remove_duplicates })  This @docannotation contains 5 parts:  * value: describes the documented element, * comment: a general comment about the documented element, * usages: a set of ways to use the documented element, each of them being in a @usage annotation. The usage contains mainly a description and and set of examples, * examples: a set of examples that are not related to a particular usage,  * see: other related keywords.  the @example annotation  This annotation contains a particular use example of the documented element. It is also used to generate unit test and patterns.  The simplest way to use it:  @example(value = 1::2, 3::4, 5::6 inter 2,4, equals = 2,4)   In this example: * value contains an example of use of the operator, * equals contains the expected results of expression in value.  This will become in the documentation:  list var3 <- 1::2, 3::4, 5::6 inter 2,4;    // var3 equals 2,4  When no variable is given in the annotation, an automatic name is generated. The type of the variable is determined thanks to the return type of the operator with these parameters.  This example can also generate a unit test model. In this case, the value in the variable will be compared to the equals part.  By default, the @example annotation has the following default values: * isTestOnly = false, meaning that the example will be added to the documentation too, * isExecutable = true, meaning that content of value can be added in a model and can be compiled (it can be useful to switch it to false, in a documentation example containing name of species that have not been defined), * test = true, meaning that the content of value will be tested to the content of equals, * isPattern = false.  How to document operators  A GAML operator is defined by a Java method annoted by the @operator annotation (see the list of all annotations for more details about annotations). In the core of GAMA, most of the operators are defined in the plugin msi.gama.core and in the package msi.gaml.operators.  The documentation generator will use information from: * the @operator annotation:   * value: it provides the name(s) of the operator (if an operator has several names, the other names will be considered as alternative names)   * category: it is used to classified the operators in categories * the @doc annotation, * the method definition:   * the return value type   * parameters and their type (if the method is static, the IScope attribute is not taken into account)  How to document statements  A GAML statement is defined by a Java class annoted by the @symbol annotation (see the list of all annotations for more details about annotations). In the core of GAMA, most of the statements are defined in the plugin msi.gama.core and in the package msi.gaml.statements.  The documentation generator will use information from: * @symbol annotation, * @facets annotation (each facet can contain a documentation in a @doc annotation), * @inside annotation (where the statement can be used), * @doc annotation  How to document skills  A GAML skill is defined by a Java class annoted by the @skill annotation (see the list of all annotations for more details about annotations). In the core of GAMA, most of the skills are defined in the plugin msi.gama.core and in the package msi.gaml.skills.  The documentation generator will use information from: * @skill annotation, * @vars annotation (each var can contain a documentation in a @doc annotation), * @doc annotation  How to change the processor  If you make some modifications in the plugin processor, you have to rebuild the .jar file associated to the processor to take in account the changes. Here are the several steps you have to do : - In the  processor  plugin, open the plugin.xml. - In exporting (from the Overview tab), click on Export Wizard. - In the tab  Destination , choose processor/plugins for the directory. In the tab  Options , delete the field Qualifier replacement. Click  finish . - Right click on the folder  processor  to refresh. –> It s ok !  General workflow of file generation  This following diagram explains roughly the workflow for the generation of the different files :   ","url":"wiki/Documentation.md"},{"id":"wiki/DevelopingControlArchitectures.md","title":" Developing architecture","content":"Developing architecture  In addition to existing control architectures, developers can add new ones.  Defining a new control architecture needs to create new statements of type behavior and included in species statements and to define how to manage their execution.  Implementation  A control architecture is a Java class, that:   * is annotated by the @skill annotation,   * extends the AbstractArchitecture class (to get benefits of everything from the reflex-based control architecture, the ReflexArchitecture class can be extended instead).  The AbstractArchitecture extends the ISkill and IStatement interfaces and add the 2 following methods:   * public abstract boolean init(IScope scope) throws GamaRuntimeException;   * public abstract void verifyBehaviors(ISpecies context);  The three main methods to implement are thus:   * public void setChildren(final List<? extends ISymbol> children): this method will be called at the compilation of the model. It allows to manage all the embeded statements (in children) and for example separate the statements that should be executed at the initialization only from the ones that should be executed at each simulation step. Following example allows to test the name of the all the embedded statements:  for ( final ISymbol c : children ) {    if( IKeyword.INIT.equals(c.getFacet(IKeyword.KEYWORD).literalValue()) ) {    * public abstract boolean init(IScope scope) throws GamaRuntimeException: this method is called only once, at the initialization of the agent.   * public Object executeOn(final IScope scope) throws GamaRuntimeException: this method is executed at each simulation step. It should manage the execution of the various embedded behaviors (e.g. their order or choose which one will be executed…) ","url":"wiki/DevelopingControlArchitectures.md"},{"id":"wiki/WebsiteGeneration.md","title":" How to write the Website Content","content":"How to write the Website Content  In this page, we will explain all about the convention we use to write and generate the website content and the wiki content. Since the release of GAMA 1.7, with the new GAMA website, we have two contents: * The wiki content is hosted in github, witch directly interpret the markdown format of the files to display them in a proper way. This wiki, since it is a wiki, can be edited by any user. It is then, in constant changes. * The website content is the content of the real GAMA website.

See Install Git version for more details.  Among all the GAMA plugins, only one is related to documentation generation: * msi.gama.documentation: it contains some useful java scripts to help you to write a correct documentation.  In addition, the folder containing the wiki files is required. In the GitHub architecture, the wiki documentation is stored in a separate Git repository https://github.com/gama-platform/gama.wiki.git. A local clone of this repository should thus be created: 1. Open the Git perspective:   * Windows > Open Perspective > Other…   * Choose Git 2.

Go back to the Java perspective: a gama.wiki plugin should have been added.  gama.wiki tree structure  The  gama.wiki  plugin contains all the wiki content, and almost all the website content. It contains a folder content which contains the following folders: * Tutorials   * LearnGAMLStepByStep: contains the linear documentation to learn about the concepts of GAML   * Recipes: contains short pieces of documentation answering a specific problematic   * Tutorials: contains applicative tutorials  * References   * ModelLibrary: contains the model library (only present in the website)    * PlatformDocumentation: contains the documentation dealing with how to use the platform   * GAMLReferences: contains GAML references   * PluginDocumentation: contains the documentation of the additional plugins * Community   * Projects: contains a presentation of the projects where GAMA is involved (only present in the website)   * Training: contains a presentation of the training sessions organized by the GAMA team (only present in the website) * WikiOnly: contains the content only present in the wiki, and not in the website   * DevelopingExtensions: contains explanations about how to extend the platform * resources: contains all the additional resources needed (images, pdf…)  For the rest of this document, the highest level of tree structure ( Tutorials / References / Community / WikiOnly ) will be named as tabs. The level just under will be named as sections, and the level under will be named as sub-section. All this content is written using the markdown format. All the images resources are included in the resources/images folder. They are actually under different sub-folders. From the markdown page, you can call the resource with the relative path resource/images/sub_folder/image_name.png. If a section/sub-section contains one of several sub-division, then those sub-divisions will be stored in a folder with the name of the corresponding section/sub-section, and this section/sub-section folder will be associated with a markdown file with the same name (indeed, a section/sub-section has its own page). If a section/sub-section has no sub-division, then this section/sub-section is simply defined with a markdown file containing the content wanted.    Notice that there is some content which is present only in the wiki (the  WikiOnly  content), some content present only in the website (the model library, most of the community content…). In fact, the wiki tree structure is determined by the file Sidebar, while the website tree structure is determined by the file _WebsiteTreeStructure.  Good practices when writing markdown files  Title  Each markdown files has to start with a title in the markdown format (like # title). This is this title which will be displayed in the tree structure of the website.  Hypertext Links  Even if the repository how have a more complexe tree structure, you don t have to (and you must not !) speficy the relative or absolute path to the target page, just naming the page will work : text_displayed(the_name_of_the_md_file)  Images Links  As already said in the previous paragraph, images have to be in an  resources/images/folder_name  folder next to your md file, so that you can write the relative path more easily.  Insert Metadatas  Metadatas in content files are written as comments, with the following syntax:   //: # (name_of_the_medatada|value_of_the_metadata)   Medatadas are not displayed in the wiki and the website content. For the website generation, metadatas are used in order to build the database, most of all to manage the search engine, and the learning graph.  Here is the list of metadata we use in the content files:   keyword : will write an invisible anchor in this exact place in the website. When the user will do a research about this word, he can access directly to this anchor. startConcept/endConcept : used to delimit a concept. The value of those two metadatas is the name of the concept. All the concepts are listed in the file  DependencyGraph , in the content folder in your wiki repository.      keyword  The value of the keyword has to have this structure : keyword_category_keyword_name (indeed, several keywords can have the same name ! The type of the keyword has to be specified). Here is the list of the several keyword categories : concept, operator, statement, species, architecture, type, constant and skill. Example of metadata : //: # (keyword|concept_3D), or //: # (keyword|operator_int).  startConcept/endConcept  The value of the keyword have to be one of the values defined in the file learningConcept.xml.  Notice that a concept in the meaning of keyword is not the same as a concept (or learning concept) in the learning graph !  Please read the part concerning the database to learn more about it.  Website generation workflow  This part is not implemented yet, it is under construction.    The gama.documentation plugin  This plugin is used to generate GAML documentation automatically in the markdown format, and copy paste the content to the wiki folder. The plugin is also used to generate the model library in the markdown format, with the source code, a quick description, and an image (screenshot). In the same time, the plugin generates a html page (an  abstract ) and put it directly in the model folder (in order to be loaded directly from GAMA).  The documentation plugin contains also 2 other scripts which helps to create content:  learningGraphDatabaseGenerator  The learningGraphDatabaseGenerator script is used to generate the  nodesDatabase.js  file, which is read to visualize the learning graph. This script needs the  learningGraph.xml  file as input. Each learning concepts has an id, a name, a very short description, a position (position in x and y in %, between 0 and 1. This value is then multiplied by the coeff in the learningGraphDatabaseGenerator), and a list of prerequisite learning concepts. A category of learning concept (also defined in the learningGraph.xml file) has an id, a position (position in x and y), a position for the hallow (position in x and y of the big circle displayed when a category is selected), a size for the hallow, a color, a name, and the list of learningConcept associated.  modelLibraryGenerator  The modelLibraryGenerator script is used to generate all the markdown files of the model library. This script     Parse all the models of the model library, and build an  input  xml file for a headless execution (this file is deleted at the end of the execution).  By default, this will ask to execute all the experiments for each model, and take a screenshot of the 10th cycle for each display.       You can change this default behavior by changing the file  modelScreenshot.xml , in the wiki repo (see description below) Execute the headless   Copy-paste all the generated images in the write folder, with the write names.   Browse a second time all the models, build the md file, including the screenshot computed from the headless execution, and analyzing the header of each model to extract the title, author and tags. Each md files respects the following format : path_from_model_with_underscore_instead_of_slash_without_strange_char +  .md . (ex :  Features/3D/3D Visualization/models/3D camera and trajectories.gaml  becomes  Features_3D_Visualization_models_3D_camera_and_trajectories.md .)   Format of the xml file to  tune up  the screenshot generation :        <experiment id=name_of_the_file_without_extention+ +model_name+ +experiment_name>   </experiment>       TODO  The gama.wiki repository  This repository contains in on hand the content auto generated by the documentation plugin, and in the other hand a handmade content. All the content is in the markdown format, organized through a specific tree structure, sometime containing metadatas.  The website repository  This repository contains: * A copy of the content of the wiki repo (copy/pasted manually to freeze a specific commit of the wiki) * A Database management system * A script used to interpret the metadatas from the content, in order to load the database * Some pages which are not in the wiki repo, and some heavy resources (such as videos)  Website database    Keyword  A keyword is a keyword that can be used for search, either manually (the user enters the wanted keyword in the searchbar of the website) or automatically (through the search tab in the navigation panel) A keyword in attached with a category (among the following names : concept, type, operator, statement, species, architecture, constant, action, attribute, skill, facet).     A keyword that is a concept can be linked with other keywords (ex : the keyword  BDI  will be linked with the keywords  eval_when ,  get_priority …)   A keyword that is a facet is linked to a statement or a species keyword (ex : the keyword  torus  will be linked with the keyword  global ).   A keyword that is an action or an attribute is linked either to a skill keyword (if it is actually an action or an attribute of a skill), an architecture keyword (if it is an action or a behavior of an architecture), or a species keyword (if it is a built-in action or attribute).   A keyword that is a statement can be linked to an architecture.   A keyword is composed of: * id (unique id) * name (the word which is searched by the user) * idCategory (id of the category)  A cagegory is composed of: * id (unique id) * name (the name of the category)    Alias  An other database is used to join an alias to an existing keyword. Ex : the word  alias  will be changed as  die .  An alias is composed of: * id (unique id) * name (name of the alias. ex :  kill ) * attachedKeywordName (name of the keyword attached. ex :  die )  Note that an alias does not know the id of the keyword, but only the name of the attached keyword(s). Indeed, the alias  integer  will give the keyword name  int , but several keywords correspond to the keyword name  int  (it can be the type  int , or the cast operator  int )    Webpage  A webpage can be either a page of the model library, a page of the gaml reference, or an other page of the documentation.  A webpage is composed of: * id (unique id) * name (name of the webpage) * webpageCategory (the name of the category of the webpage, a value among modelPage, docPage, gamlRefPage_).  The tables webpage and keyword are linked through an association table. This association table contains also an anchor (an anchor has an unique value) to the wanted paged.    Note that only the keywords which have the category concept, species, type, operator, skill and constant can be attached to a webpage.  The keywords which have the category action, attribute and facet forward to the attached keyword.  The keywords which have the category statement are attached to a webpage only if they are not attached to another keyword. If they are attached to another keyword (an architecture keyword), then the statement keyword forward to the attached keyword.  LearningConcept  LearningConcept is used to build the learning graph (notice that a  learning concept  and a  keyword concept  is not the same thing !)  A LearningConcept is composed with:     id (unique id)   name (name of the learning concept)   A LearningConcept is linked to a webpage through an association table. This table is composed also with two anchors that are used to delimit the position of the learning concept in a page (the beginning position and the ending position).  A LearningConcept can be associated to other LearningConcepts through an association table, used to spefify the  prerequisite concepts .    Loading the Database  The database is loaded from a gathering of independent files. Some of those files are handmade written, other are generated automatically.  Role of the documentation generation script in the construction of the database  As explained in the explication of the documentation generation pages, the documentation generation script is used to generate the gaml references and the model library pages (in the markdown format with metadatas), but also to build two files category.txt and keyword.xml.  The file category.txt is a very simple file, listing the different keyword categories. This file will be used to build the Category table.  Format of the file:  concept, type, statement, species, architecture, operator, skill, constant, action, attribute, facet   The file keyword.xml is an xml file that contains all the possible keywords (all except some keywords written manually directly in the documentation pages). The GAML words can be found directly using the code of GAMA. The concept words can be found using the code of GAMA (thanks to the tag  category ) and also by using the tags in the header of the model files. This xml file will be used to build the Keyword and the AssociationKeywordCategory tables.  Format of the file:        keywordname   keywordcategory keywordId1     keywordId2          Note that: * The list associatedKeywordList contains only one element for the facet keywords, one of no element for the action or attribute keywords (none when the action/attribute is a built-in), several or no elements for the concept keywords, and none for the other type of keywords.     The id is build with the value of the attribute  name  and with the value of the attribute  category  for every keywords except the statement, facet, action and attribute keywords, which need also the value of the associatedKeyword linked. Ex : the id of the facet  torus  will be  facet_torus_statement_global .   Preparation of the repository before the generation of the database  After the generation of the markdown content in the wiki repository, two other files have to be built manually : the files alias.txt and learningConcept.xml.  The alias.txt file contains all the connexions between alias and keyword name. It will be used to build the Alias table.  Format of the file :  aliasName1:remplacedWord1 aliasName2:remplacedWord2 kill:die   The learningConcept.xml file is used to list the learning concepts, and to connect them to their prerequisite concepts. It will be used to build the LearningConcept and the AssociationLearningConcept tables.  Format of the file :        learningConceptName learningConcept1     learningConcept2...         Note that the value of the attribute  name  can be used as an unique id.  Role of the website content generation script in the construction of the database  After copy-paste the content to the website folder, a script is used to build the database and to generate website content.  The Category, Alias, LearningConcept and AssociationLearningConcept tables are loaded easily from the files category.txt, alias.txt, and learningConcept.xml.  The Keyword and AssociationKeywordCategory tables are loaded from the keyword.xml file. Note that those two tables are not entirely loaded yet, because other keywords can be presents in the header of other files.  The markdown files are converted one by one into html format.       When a metadata startConcept/endConcept is found (syntax : //: # (beginAnchor name_of_learning_concept)), the metadata is replaced with an anchor in the page (with an unique id), and the AssociationWebpageConcept table is updated.  When a metadata keyword is found (syntax :  //: # (keyword name_of_keyword_category_name_of_keyword)), the metadata is replaced with an anchor in the page (with an unique id), and the AssociationWebpageKeyword table is updated (the Keyword and AssociationKeywordCategory are updated if the keyword does not exist yet in the table).       Manage concepts keywords  ALL the concepts must be declared in the  IConcept  java class. If you want to add a new concept, please check before if your the concept you want to add cannot be remplaced by one of the existing concept. If it is the case, you can add your word as if it was an alias, pointing to the existing concept. Note that all the alias are listed in the alias.txt file. If you realy think that the concept has to be added, please add it to the IConcept file, and also to (one or several) of the lists CONCEPTS_NOT_FOR_GAML_REF, CONCEPTS_NOT_FOR_MODEL_LIBRARY, CONCEPTS_DEDICATED_TO_SYNTAX in the ConceptManager class if needed.  Most of the keywords of the website (used for the search) are managed automatically. But the  concepts  keywords have to be (partially) hand-made managed. You can add the concepts with 3 differents methods :  In the Documentation  Documentation  here designs all the content manually written in the wiki. All those pages can contain  concepts  through the metadata format :  //: # (keyword|concept_name_of_concept)  You can either : - place those metadatas anywhere in the page if you want to point directly in this part of the page if the user makes a search - place those metadatas above the title : doing this, the  automatic search  (left navigation panel) will be made with this concept. You have to be really sure this concept is the main concept of the page to place it there.  In the Model library Directly from the gaml files of the model library, you can add the concept you want through the  Tags  in the header of the model.  Exemple :   /** * Name: 3D Display model of differents shapes and a special Object * Author:  * Description: Model presenting a 3D display of differents shapes (pyramid, cone, cylinder, sphere and a teapot object) to represent the same agents but with *       different aspects. Five experiments are possible, one for each of the shapes presented previously. In each experiment, the agents move to create a big circle but flee *       from their closest neighbour.  * Tags: 3d, shape, neighbors */   Note that if you don t want this model to have a page in the website, you can name it starting with the character _.  In the GAML References You can add a concept to a gaml word by using the syntax concept = { IConcept.MY_CONCEPT }.  Exemple :   @operator(value = flip,  concept = { IConcept.RANDOM }     The following text has been automatically generated from  mainCheckConcepts   ______ last update : 2019/01/24 05:23:21  List of

built-in simple types (int, bool…) and more complex ones (path, graph…). Developing a new type allows, then, to add a new data structure to GAML.  Implementation Developing a new type requiers the implementation of 2 Java files:   * the first one that describes the data structure (e.g.: GamaColor.java to define a type color)   * the second one that implements the type itself, wrapping the data structure file (e.g.: GamaColorType.java), and providing accessors to data structure attributes.  The data structure file  The class representing the data structure is a Java class annotated by:   * a @vars annotation to describe the attributes of a complex type. The @vars annotation contains a set of @var elements.  @vars({ @var(name = IKeyword.COLOR_RED, type = IType.INT), @var(name = IKeyword.COLOR_GREEN, type = IType.INT),  @var(name = IKeyword.COLOR_BLUE, type = IType.INT), @var(name = IKeyword.ALPHA, type = IType.INT),  @var(name = IKeyword.BRIGHTER, type = IType.COLOR), @var(name = IKeyword.DARKER, type = IType.COLOR) }) public class GamaColor extends Color implements IValue {   It can contain setter and/or getter for each of its attributes. Setters and getters are methods annotated by the @getter or @setter annotations.  @getter(IKeyword.COLOR_RED) public Integer red() {  return super.getRed(); }   In addition it is recommended that this class implements the IValue interface. It provides a clean way to give a string representation of the type and thus eases good serialization of the object. To this purpose the following method needs to be implemented:  public abstract String stringValue(IScope scope) throws GamaRuntimeException;   The type file  The class representing the type is a Java class such that:   * the class should be annotated by the @type annotation,   * the class should extend the class GamaType<DataStructureFile> (and thus implement its 3 methods),  Example (from GamaFloatType.java):  @type(name = IKeyword.FLOAT, id = IType.FLOAT, wraps = { Double.class, double.class }, kind = ISymbolKind.Variable.NUMBER)   Inheritance from the GamaType<T> class Each java class aiming at implement a type should inherit from the GamaType abstract class. Example (from GamaColorType.java):  public class GamaColorType extends GamaType<GamaColor>   This class imposes to implement the three following methods (with the example of the GamaColorType):   * public boolean canCastToConst()   * public GamaColor cast(IScope scope, Object obj, Object param): the way to cast any object in the type,   * public GamaColor getDefault(): to define the default value of a variable of the current type.  Remark: for each type, an unary operator is created with the exact name of the type. It can be used to cast any expression in the given type. This operator calls the previous cast method.  Annotations  @type It provides information necessary to the processor to identify a type.  This annotation contains:   * name (String,    by default): a String representing the type name in GAML.   * id (int, 0 by default): the unique identifier for this type. User-added types can be chosen between IType.AVAILABLE_TYPE and IType.SPECIES_TYPE (exclusive) (cf. IType.java).   * wraps (tab of Class, null by default): the list of Java Classes this type is  wrapping  (i.e. representing). The first one is the one that will be used preferentially throughout GAMA. The other ones are to ensure compatibility, in operators, with compatible Java classes (for instance, List and GamaList).   * kind (int, ISymbolKind.Variable.REGULAR by default): the kind of Variable used to store this type. See ISymbolKind.Variable.   * internal (boolean, false by default): whether this type is for internal use only.   * doc (set of @doc, empty by default): the documentation associated to the facet.  All these annotations are defined in the file GamlAnnotations.java.

Vocabulary: Each project is either designed as a plugin (containing an xml file  plugin.xml ) or as a feature (containing an xml file  feature.xml ).   * A plugin can be seen as a module (or bundle in the OSGI architecture), which can be necessary (the GAMA platform can t run without it) or optional (providing new functionalities to the platform). This decomposition between several plugins ensure the cohesion between functional blocks, each plugin has to be as independent as he can.   * A feature is a group of one or several modules (or plugin), which can be loaded. NB : Unlike a plugin, a feature does not include source code, but only two files : a build.properties and a feature.xml.  To see how to create a plugin and a feature, please read this page.

Additional attributes and actions can be defined. It could be very useful in order to define its behavior thanks to external libraries (e.g. mulit-criteria decision-making, database connection…).  A new built-in species extends the GamlAgent class, which defines the basic GAML agents. As a consequence, new built-in species have all the attributes (name, shape, …) and actions (die…) of regular species.  Implementation  A new species can be any Java class that:   * extends the GamlAgent class,   * begins by the @species: @species(name = name_of_the_species_gaml),  @species(name = multicriteria_analyzer) public class MulticriteriaAnalyzer extends GamlAgent {   Similarly to skills, a species can define additional attributes and actions.  Additional attributes  Defining new attributes needs:   * to add @vars (and one embedded @var per additional attribute) annotation on top of the class,   * to define @setter and @getter annotations to the accessors methods.  For example, regular species are defined with the following annotation:  @vars({ @var(name = IKeyword.NAME, type = IType.STRING), @var(name = IKeyword.PEERS, type = IType.LIST),  @var(name = IKeyword.HOST, type = IType.AGENT),  @var(name = IKeyword.LOCATION, type = IType.POINT, depends_on = IKeyword.SHAPE),  @var(name = IKeyword.SHAPE, type = IType.GEOMETRY) })   And accessors are defined using:     @getter(IKeyword.NAME) public abstract String getName();  @setter(IKeyword.NAME) public abstract void setName(String name);      Additional actions  An additional action is a method annotated by the @action annotation.  @action(name = ISpecies.stepActionName) public Object _step_(final IScope scope) {   Annotations ### @species This annotation represents a  species  in GAML.

By default, Eclipse uses Java 7 when it is installed whereas GAMA only needs Java 6. On MacOS X in particular, we may have to change the version of the JDK to ensure that GAMA will run smoothly.     * Window->Preferences     * In: Java / Compiler: set  Compiler compliance level  to 1.6     * In: Java / Installed JREs -> Add -> Standard VM -> JRE home -> Directory and choose the directory of a Java 6 JDK (preferable) or a Java 7 JDK (except for MacOS X, see Installation).       * Download the JDK 6 (for Windows & Linux) here       * Download the JDK 7 (for Windows & Linux) here.       * Download the JDK 6 (for Mac OS X) here. To switch between 1.7 and 1.6 (if both are installed), look at the use of java-home on this page.     * In: Java / Installed JREs -> select Java 1.6 (for Mac) or 1.7 (on Windows & Linux).   1. You should configure the GAMA .product file depending on your OS.     * In the msi.gama.application project, open the gama1.6.1.feature_based_release.product file.     * In: the  Launching  tab: check whether the launching options are correct       * In particular, for a 32bits OS, you have to change in  VM Arguments   -Xmx1536m  into  -Xmx1024m        * For 64bits OS, check that the option  -d32  is not in the  VM Arguments  (otherwise delete it) in the  macosx  specific tab.   1. Compile and Run GAMA     * Do a  Project -> Clean… (clean all projects)      * In the .product file, in  Overview  tab:       * click on the � Synchronize � link. This will ensure your product has updated the inclusion of the plugins (from both Eclipse and the new XText). Do not forget to save it.       * The product, or some of the included features, may complain about missing plugins (identified by an error icon on the plugin icon in the dependencies view). It is normal for  fragments  that apply to another OS than yours and it is harmless in this case. If you are, however, concerned about this, you can install the  delta-pack  for Eclipse 3.7.2 or Eclipse 3.8.2 (follow these steps: http://ugosan.org/eclipse-rcp-delta-pack/. The delta pack itself can be downloaded from here).       * If one of the missing plugins happens to be  com.ibm.icu.base  (and you did not want to install it as told above), you can replace it by  com.ibm.icu  without worries.       * As of GAMA 1.6.1, we use a version of the SWT binary fragments that is not the one shipped with Eclipse Indigo nor Juno. Although it is not mandatory to use it, it is required if you plan to produce release versions of GAMA from your product. To install it, simply download this file and install it like the delta pack above.       * click on the � Launch an Eclipse application � link. Note that a run configuration will be automatically created allowing to only click on the run button for future runs.  If the GAMA launch crashes:   * Open Run configurations….   * In Eclipse Application / gama1.6.1.feature_based_release.product configuration, open the plug-ins pane   * After Launch with: , choose  all workspace and enable plug-ins .  Detailed Instructions for Eclipse 3.8.2  First note that GAMA will not work with the packaged Juno version (in fact version 4.2 of Eclipse). Instead, you will need to download the core Eclipse package (Eclipse SDK) from http://archive.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.8.2-201301310800/ , and to install additional plugins using this repository: http://download.eclipse.org/releases/juno/ . Among these additional plugins, only the EMF (Eclipse Modeling Framework) components should be necessary. In  Modeling :   * EMF - Eclipse Modeling Framework SDK   * EMF Validation Frameworkd SDK  The same instructions (than for Eclipse 3.7.2) can then be applied to this installation, with three differences :   * The delta-pack for Juno is available here.   * The name of the product to use is  gama1.6.1.feature_based_Eclipse3_8_2_updatable_release.product   * The version of XText to use is 2.8.2 and it should be obtained from here, as this site will also provide updates for EMF and other components necessary for XText to work (you may need to install these components first, notably EMF ones, if the installation of XText does not work).

Regarding Java, we strongly recommend to install the Java Oracle 1.8 JDK that can be downloaded here.  Unpack it and launch it. Please refer to this link for more information on running Eclipse.  One important step required for GAMA to correctly produce its supporting files once it will have been installed is to set the default encoding of the workspace to UTF-8. It can be done by selecting, in the Preferences,  General , then  Workspace , then  Text file encoding  and choosing  UTF-8  in the drop-down menu available in  Other: .  If you install another version of Eclipse, please keep in mind that GAMA is compatible only, for the moment, with XText 2.14.0 (see here to obtain it).  Install additional required components to Eclipse  The Xtext plugin provided with the Eclipse release should be updated to XText 2.14. 1. Open the install window:   * Help > Install new softwares 2.

Developing a new statement allows, then, to add a new instruction to GAML.  Defining the class  A new statement must be a Java class that:   * either implements the interface IStatement or extends an existing implementation of this interface (like AbstractStatement or AbstractSequenceStatement).   * begins by the 2 following mandatory annotations:     * @symbol: @symbol(name = name_of_the_statement_gaml, kind = kind_of_statement, with_sequence = true/false),     * @inside: @symbol(kinds = {kind_of_statement_1,kind_of_statement_2,...}  In addition the 4 following optional annotations can be added:   * @facets: to describe the set of @facet annotations,   * @doc: to document the statement.   * @serializer: in addition, statements can benefit from a custom serializer, by declaring @serializer(CustomSerializer.class), with a class extending SymbolSerializer.   * @validator: in addition, statements can benefit from a custom validation during the validation process, by declaring @validator(CustomValidator.class) with a class implementing IDescriptionValidator as value. This class will receive the IDescription of the statement and be able to execute further validations on the type of expressions, etc. or even to change the IDescription  (by adding new information, changing the value of facets, etc.).  Note: GAMA annotations are classes defined into the msi.gama.precompiler.GamlAnnotations class.  Examples  The write statement  The write statement is an example of a SINGLE_STATEMENT (i.e. statement that does not embed a sequence of statements). It can used inside a BEHAVIOR statement (i.e. reflex, init…), a SEQUENCE_STATEMENT (e.g. loop, ask, if…) or a LAYER statement. It defines a single facet ( message ) mandatory and omissible.  @symbol(name = IKeyword.WRITE, kind = ISymbolKind.SINGLE_STATEMENT, with_sequence = false) @inside(kinds = { ISymbolKind.BEHAVIOR, ISymbolKind.SEQUENCE_STATEMENT, ISymbolKind.LAYER }) @facets(value = {   @facet(name = IKeyword.MESSAGE, type = IType.NONE, optional = false)     }, omissible = IKeyword.MESSAGE) public class WriteStatement extends AbstractStatement {   The aspect statement  The aspect statement defines an example of BEHAVIOR statement (i.e. a statement that can written at the same level as init, reflex…), containing a sequence of embedded statements. It can only be used inside a species statement (i.e. the definition of a new species) and the global block. It defines a single facet name mandatory and omissible.  @symbol(name = { IKeyword.ASPECT }, kind = ISymbolKind.BEHAVIOR, with_sequence = true, unique_name = true) @inside(kinds = { ISymbolKind.SPECIES, ISymbolKind.MODEL }) @facets(value = { @facet(name = IKeyword.NAME, type = IType.ID, optional = true)     }, omissible = IKeyword.NAME) public class AspectStatement extends AbstractStatementSequence {   The action statement  The action statement defines an example of ACTION statement containing a sequence of embedded statements and that can have arguments. It can be used (to define an action) in any species, experiment or global statement. It defines several facets and uses a custom validator and a custom serializer.  @symbol(name = IKeyword.ACTION, kind = ISymbolKind.ACTION, with_sequence = true, with_args = true, unique_name = true) @inside(kinds = { ISymbolKind.SPECIES, ISymbolKind.EXPERIMENT, ISymbolKind.MODEL }) @facets(value = {  @facet(name = IKeyword.NAME, type = IType.ID, optional = false),  @facet(name = IKeyword.TYPE, type = IType.TYPE_ID, optional = true, internal = true),  @facet(name = IKeyword.OF, type = IType.TYPE_ID, optional = true, internal = true),  @facet(name = IKeyword.INDEX, type = IType.TYPE_ID, optional = true, internal = true),  @facet(name = IKeyword.VIRTUAL, type = IType.BOOL, optional = true)      }, omissible = IKeyword.NAME) @validator(ActionValidator.class) @serializer(ActionSerializer.class) public class ActionStatement extends AbstractStatementSequenceWithArgs {   Implementation  All the statements inherits from the abstract class AbstractStatement. Statements with a sequence of embedded statements inherit from the class AbstractStatementSequence (which extends AbstractStatement).  The main methods of a statement class are:   * its constructor, that is executed at the compilation of the model.   * executeOn(final IScope scope), it executes the statement on a given scope. This method is executed at each call of the statement in the model,   * privateExecuteIn(IScope scope): the executeOn(final IScope scope) method implemented in AbstractStatement does some verification and call the privateExecuteIn(IScope scope) method to perform the statement. The execution of any statement should be redefined in this method.  Define a SINGLE_STATEMENT statement  To define a SINGLE_STATEMENT statement that can be executed in any behavior and sequence of statements and with 2 facets, we first define a new Java class that extends AbstractStatement such as:  @symbol(name = testStatement, kind = ISymbolKind.SINGLE_STATEMENT, with_sequence = false) @inside(kinds = { ISymbolKind.BEHAVIOR, ISymbolKind.SEQUENCE_STATEMENT}) @facets(value = {   @facet(name = IKeyword.NAME, type = IType.NONE, optional = false),  @facet(name = test_facet, type = IType.NONE, optional = true)  }, omissible = IKeyword.NAME) public class SingleStatementExample extends AbstractStatement {   The class should at least implement:   * a constructor: the constructor is called at the compilation. It is usually used to get the expressions given to the facets (using the getFacet(String) method) and to store it into an attribute of the class.     final IExpression name;  public SingleStatementExample(final IDescription desc) {  super(desc);  name = getFacet(IKeyword.NAME); }    * the **method privateExecuteIn**: this method is executed each time the statement is called in the model.  protected Object privateExecuteIn(IScope scope) throws GamaRuntimeException {   IAgent agent = stack.getAgentScope();  String nameStr = null;  if ( agent != null && !agent.dead() ) {   nameStr = Cast.asString(stack, name.value(stack));   if ( nameStr == null ) {    nameStr =  nil ;   }   GuiUtils.informConsole(nameStr);  }  return nameStr; }     The variable scope of type IScope can be used to:   * get the current agent with: scope.getAgentScope()   * evaluate an expression in the current scope: Cast.asString(scope, message.value(scope))  Define a statement with sequence  This kind of statements includes SEQUENCE_STATEMENT (e.g. if, loop,…), BEHAVIOR (e.g. reflex,…)…  Such a statement is defined in a class extending the AbstractStatementSequence class, e.g.:     @symbol(name = { IKeyword.REFLEX, IKeyword.INIT }, kind = ISymbolKind.BEHAVIOR, with_sequence = true, unique_name = true) @inside(kinds = { ISymbolKind.SPECIES, ISymbolKind.EXPERIMENT, ISymbolKind.MODEL }) @facets(value = { @facet(name = IKeyword.WHEN, type = IType.BOOL, optional = true),  @facet(name = IKeyword.NAME, type = IType.ID, optional = true) }, omissible = IKeyword.NAME) @validator(ValidNameValidator.class)  public class ReflexStatement extends AbstractStatementSequence {      This class should only implement a constructor. The class AbstractStatementSequence provides a generic implementation for:   * privateExecuteIn(IScope scope): it executes each embedded statement with the scope.   * executeOn(final IScope scope): it executes the statement with a given scope.  Additional methods that can implemented  The following methods have a default implementation, but can be overridden if necessary:   * the String getTrace(final IScope scope) method is called to trace the execution of statements using trace statement.  public String getTrace(final IScope scope) {  // We dont trace write statements  return ; }     * the setChildren(final List<? extends ISymbol> commands) is used to define which are the statement children to the sequence statement. By default, all the embedded statements are taken as children  Annotations ### @symbol This annotation represents a  statement  in GAML, and is used to define its name(s) as well as some meta-data that will be used during the validation process.  This annotation contains:   * name (set of string, empty by default): names of the statement.   * kind (int): the kind of the annotated symbol (see ISymbolKind.java for more details).   * with_scope (boolean, true by default): indicates if the statement (usually a sequence) defines its own scope. Otherwise, all the temporary variables defined in it are actually defined in the super-scope.   * with_sequence (boolean): indicates wether or not a sequence can or should follow the symbol denoted by this class.   * with_args (boolean, false by default): indicates wether or not the symbol denoted by this class will accept arguments.   * remote_context (boolean, false by default): indicates that the context of this statement is actually an hybrid context: although it will be executed in a remote context, any temporary variables declared in the enclosing scopes should be passed on as if the statement was executed in the current context.   * doc (set of @doc, empty by default): the documentation attached to this symbol.  @inside This annotation is used in conjunction with symbol. Provides a way to tell where this symbol should be located in a model (i.e. what its parents should be). Either direct symbol names (in symbols) or generic symbol kinds can be used.  This annotation contains:   * symbols (set of Strings, empty by default): symbol names of the parents.   * kinds (set of int, empty by default): generic symbol kinds of the parents (see ISymbolKind.java for more details).  @facets This annotation describes a list of facets used by a statement in GAML.  This annotation contains:   * value (set of @facet): array of @facet, each representing a facet name, type..   * ommissible (string): the facet that can be safely omitted by the modeler (provided its value is the first following the keyword of the statement).  @facet This facet describes a facet in a list of facets.  This annotation contains:   * name (String): the name of the facet. Must be unique within a symbol.   * type (set of Strings): the string values of the different types that can be taken by this facet.   * values (set of Strings): the values that can be taken by this facet. The value of the facet expression will be chosen among the values described here.   * optional (boolean, false by default): whether or not this facet is optional or mandatory.   * doc (set of @doc, empty by default): the documentation associated to the facet.  @doc It provides a unified way of attaching documentation to the various GAML elements tagged by the other annotations. The documentation is automatically assembled at compile time and also used at runtime in GAML editors.   * value (String,    by default): a String representing the documentation of a GAML element.   * deprecated (String,    by default): a String indicating (if it is not empty) that the element is deprecated and defining, if possible, what to use instead.   * returns (String,    by default): the documentation concerning the value(s) returned by this element (if any)..   * comment (String,    by default): an optional comment that will appear differently from the documentation itself.   * special_cases (set of Strings, empty by default): an array of String representing the documentation of the  special cases  in which the documented element takes part.   * examples (set of Strings, empty by default): an array of String representing some examples or use-cases about how to use this element.   * see (set of Strings, empty by default): an array of String representing cross-references to other elements in GAML.  @serializer It allows to declare a custom serializer for Symbols (statements, var declarations, species ,experiments, etc.). This serializer will be called instead of the standard serializer, superseding this last one. Serializers must be sublasses of the SymbolSerializer class.   * value (Class): the serializer class.  @validator It allows to declare a custom validator for Symbols (statements, var declarations, species ,experiments, etc.). This validator, if declared on subclasses of Symbol, will be called after the standard validation is done. The validator must be subclass of IDescriptionValidator.   * value (Class): the validator class.  All these annotations are defined in the GamlAnnotations.java file of the msi.gama.processor plug-in.

An operator performs a function on one, two, or n operands (which are other expressions and thus may be themselves composed of operators) and returns the result of this function. Developing a new operator allows, then, to add a new function to GAML.  Implementation  A new operator can be any Java method that:   * begins by the @operator (other fields can be added to the annotation): @operator(value = name_of_the_operator_gaml),  @operator(value = rgb) public static GamaColor rgb(final int r, final int g, final int b, final double alpha) {    The method:   * must return a value (that has to be one of the GAMA Type: Integer, Double, Boolean, String, IShape, IList, IGraph, IAgent…),   * can define any number of parameters, defined using Java type,   * can be either static or non-static:     * in the case it is static, the number of parameters (except an IScope attribute) of the method is equal to the number of operands of the GAML operator.     * in the case it is not static, a first operand is added to the operator with the type of the current class.   * can have a IScope parameter, that will be taken into account as operand of the operator.  Annotations ### @operator This annotation represents an  operator  in GAML, and is used to define its name(s) as well as some meta-data that will be used during the validation process.  This annotation contains:   * value (set of string, empty by default): names of the operator.   * content_type (integer) : if the operator returns a container, type of elements contained in the container   * can_be_const (boolean, false by default): if true: if the operands are constant, returns a constant value.   * category (set of string, empty by default): categories to which the operator belong (for documentation purpose).   * doc (set of @doc, empty by default): the documentation attached to this operator.  @doc It provides a unified way of attaching documentation to the various GAML elements tagged by the other annotations. The documentation is automatically assembled at compile time and also used at runtime in GAML editors.   * value (String,    by default): a String representing the documentation of a GAML element.   * deprecated (String,    by default): a String indicating (if it is not empty) that the element is deprecated and defining, if possible, what to use instead.   * returns (String,    by default): the documentation concerning the value(s) returned by this element (if any)..   * comment (String,    by default): an optional comment that will appear differently from the documentation itself.   * special_cases (set of Strings, empty by default): an array of String representing the documentation of the  special cases  in which the documented element takes part.   * examples (set of Strings, empty by default): an array of String representing some examples or use-cases about how to use this element.   * see (set of Strings, empty by default): an array of String representing cross-references to other elements in GAML.  All these annotations are defined in the GamlAnnotations.java file of the msi.gama.processor plug-in. ","url":"wiki/DevelopingOperators.md"},{"id":"wiki/DevelopingSkills.md","title":" Developing a New Skill","content":"Developing a New Skill  A skill adds new features (attributes) and new capabilities (actions) to the instances of the species that use it.  Defining the class  A Skill is basically a singleton and stateless Java class that:   * extends the abstract class Skill,   * begins by the annotation @skill: @skill(name = name_of_the_skill_in_gaml).  Note: GAMA annotations are classes defined into the msi.gama.precompiler.GamlAnnotations class.  Defining new attributes  To add new attributes to the species that declares this skill, developers have to define them before the class using the @vars and @variable annotations. The @vars annotation contains a set of @variable elements.  In a @variable element, one has to define the name, the type and the default value of the attribute. For example in MovingSkill:  @vars({   @variable(name = IKeyword.SPEED, type = IType.FLOAT, init = 1.0),   @variable(name = IKeyword.HEADING, type = IType.INT, init = rnd(359)) })   In order to detail how to access these new attributes (if needed), developers have to define a getter (using @getter) and a setter (using @setter) methods. If no getter (and setter) is defined, the attribute can nevertheless be set and get, using implicit by default getter and setter. But as soon as a getter and/or a setter is defined, they replace the implicit default ones. For example:     @getter(IKeyword.SPEED) public double getSpeed(final IAgent agent) {     return (Double) agent.getAttribute(IKeyword.SPEED); }  @setter(IKeyword.SPEED) public void setSpeed(final IAgent agent, final double s) {     agent.setAttribute(IKeyword.SPEED, s); }      Defining new actions An action (also called primitive) is basically a Java method that can be called from the GAML language using the same syntax as the one used for calling actions defined in a model. The method should be annotated with @action, supplying the name of the action as it will be available in GAML.  The developer can also define parameters for this action using the annotation @arg will a set of parameters names. For example, the action goto of the MovingSkill is defined as follows:     @action(name= goto , args={      @arg(name =  target , type = { IType.AGENT, IType.POINT,IType.GEOMETRY }, optional = false),     @arg(name = IKeyword.SPEED, type = IType.FLOAT, optional = true),     @arg(name =  on , type = { IType.GRAPH }, optional = true)     } )  public IPath primGoto(final IScope scope) throws GamaRuntimeException { … }  It is called in GAMA models with:  do goto (target: the_target, on: the_graph);  or  path path_followed <- self goto (target: the_target, on: the_graph, return_path: true);      Access to parameters in actions To get the value of the arguments passed in GAML to the Java code, two methods can be useful:   * scope.hasArg(name_of_argument) returns a boolean value testing whether the argument  name_of_argument  has been defined by the modeler, since all the arguments to actions should be considered as optional.   * getArg(name_arg,IType), getFloatArg(name_param_of_float), getIntArg(name_param_of_int) and their variants return the value of the given parameter using a given (or predefined) type to cast it.  Warnings Developers should notice that:   * the method associated with an action has to return a non-void object.   * the method should have only one parameter: the scope (type IScope).   * the method can only throw GamaRuntimeExceptions. Other exceptions should be caught in the method and wrapped in a GamaRuntimeException before being thrown.  Annotations ### @skill This annotations Allows to define a new skill (class grouping variables and actions that can be used by agents).  This annotation contains:   * name (String): a String representing the skill name in GAML (must be unique throughout GAML).   * attach_to (set of strings): an array of species names to which the skill will be automatically added (complements the  skills  parameter of species).   * internal (boolean, false by default): return whether this skill is for internal use only.   * doc (set of @doc, empty by default): the documentation associated to the skill.  @variable This annotations is used to describe a single variable or field.  This annotation contains:   * name (String): the name of the variable as it can be used in GAML.   * type (int): The textual representation of the type of the variable (see IType).   * of (int, 0 by default): The textual representation of the content type of the variable (see IType#defaultContentType()).   * index (int, 0 by default): The textual representation of the index type of the variable (see IType#defaultKeyType()).   * constant (int, false by default): returns whether or not this variable should be considered as non modifiable.   * init (String,    by default): the initial value of this variable as a String that will be interpreted by GAML.   * depend_on (set of Strings, empty by default): an array of String representing the names of the variables on which this variable depends (so that they are computed before).   * internal (boolean, false by default): return whether this var is for internal use only.   * doc (set of @doc, empty by default): the documentation associated to the variable.  @doc It provides a unified way of attaching documentation to the various GAML elements tagged by the other annotations. The documentation is automatically assembled at compile time and also used at runtime in GAML editors.   * value (String,    by default): a String representing the documentation of a GAML element.   * deprecated (String,    by default): a String indicating (if it is not empty) that the element is deprecated and defining, if possible, what to use instead.   * returns (String,    by default): the documentation concerning the value(s) returned by this element (if any)..   * comment (String,    by default): an optional comment that will appear differently from the documentation itself.   * special_cases (set of Strings, empty by default): an array of String representing the documentation of the  special cases  in which the documented element takes part.   * examples (set of Strings, empty by default): an array of String representing some examples or use-cases about how to use this element.   * see (set of Strings, empty by default): an array of String representing cross-references to other elements in GAML.  @getter This annotations is used to indicate that a method is to be used as a getter for a variable defined in the class. The variable must be defined on its own (in vars).  This annotation contains:   * value (String): the name of the variable for which the annotated method is to be considered as a getter.   * initializer (boolean, false by default): returns whether or not this getter should also be used as an initializer  @setter This annotations is used to indicate that a method is to be used as a setter for a variable defined in the class. The variable must be defined on its own (in vars).  This annotation contains:   * value (String): the name of the variable for which the annotated method is to be considered as a setter.  @action This annotations is used to tag a method that will be considered as an action (or primitive) in GAML. The method must have the following signature:  Object methodName(IScope) throws GamaRuntimeException and be contained in a class annotated with @species or @skill (or a related class, like a subclass or an interface).  This annotation contains:   * name (String): the name of the variable as it can be used in GAML.   * virtual (boolean, false by default): if true the action is virtual, i.e. equivalent to abstract method in java.   * args (set of arg, empty by default): the list of arguments passed to this action. Each argument is an instance of arg.   * doc (set of @doc, empty by default): the documentation associated to the action.  @arg This annotations describes an argument passed to an action.  This annotation contains:   * name (String,    by default): the name of the argument as it can be used in GAML.   * type (set of ints, empty by default): An array containing the textual representation of the types that can be taken by the argument (see IType).   * optional (boolean, true by default): whether this argument is optional or not.   * doc (set of @doc, empty by default): the documentation associated to the argument.

Definition  Operators in the GAML language are used to compose complex expressions. An operator performs a function on one, two, or n operands (which are other expressions and thus may be themselves composed of operators) and returns the result of this function.  Most of them use a classical prefixed functional syntax (i.e. operator_name(operand1, operand2, operand3), see below), with the exception of arithmetic (e.g. +, /), logical (and, or), comparison (e.g. >, <), access (., ..) and pair (::) operators, which require an infixed notation (i.e. operand1 operator_symbol operand1).  The ternary functional if-else operator, ? :, uses a special infixed syntax composed with two symbols (e.g. operand1 ? operand2 : operand3). Two unary operators (- and !) use a traditional prefixed syntax that does not require parentheses unless the operand is itself a complex expression (e.g.   - 10, ! (operand1 or operand2) ).  Finally, special constructor operators ({...} for constructing points, ... for constructing lists and maps) will require their operands to be placed between their two symbols (e.g. {1,2,3}, operand1, operand2, ..., operandn or key1::value1, key2::value2... keyn::valuen).  With the exception of these special cases above, the following rules apply to the syntax of operators: * if they only have one operand, the functional prefixed syntax is mandatory (e.g. operator_name(operand1)) * if they have two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. operator_name(operand1, operand2)) or the infixed syntax (e.g. operand1 operator_name operand2) can be used. * if they have more than two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. operator_name(operand1, operand2, ..., operand)) or a special infixed syntax with the first operand on the left-hand side of the operator name (e.g. operand1 operator_name(operand2, ..., operand)) can be used.  All of these alternative syntaxes are completely equivalent.  Operators in GAML are purely functional, i.e. they are guaranteed to not have any side effects on their operands. For instance, the shuffle operator, which randomizes the positions of elements in a list, does not modify its list operand but returns a new shuffled list.    Priority between operators  The priority of operators determines, in the case of complex expressions composed of several operators, which one(s) will be evaluated first.  GAML follows in general the traditional priorities attributed to arithmetic, boolean, comparison operators, with some twists. Namely: * the constructor operators, like ::, used to compose pairs of operands, have the lowest priority of all operators (e.g. a > b :: b > c will return a pair of boolean values, which means that the two comparisons are evaluated before the operator applies. Similarly, a > 10, b > 5 will return a list of boolean values. * it is followed by the ?: operator, the functional if-else (e.g.   a > b ? a + 10 : a - 10 will return the result of the if-else). * next are the logical operators, and and or (e.g. a > b or b > c will return the value of the test) * next are the comparison operators (i.e. >, <, <=, >=, =, !=) * next the arithmetic operators in their logical order (multiplicative operators have a higher priority than additive operators) * next the unary operators - and ! * next the access operators . and  (e.g. {1,2,3}.x > 20 + {4,5,6}.y  will return the result of the comparison between the x and y ordinates of the two points) * and finally the functional operators, which have the highest priority of all.    Using actions as operators  Actions defined in species can be used as operators, provided they are called on the correct agent. The syntax is that of normal functional operators, but the agent that will perform the action must be added as the first operand.  For instance, if the following species is defined:   species spec1 {  int min(int x, int y) {       return x > y ? x : y;  } }   Any agent instance of spec1 can use min as an operator (if the action conflicts with an existing operator, a warning will be emitted). For instance, in the same model, the following line is perfectly acceptable:   global {  init {       create spec1;       spec1 my_agent <- spec10;       int the_min <- my_agent min(10,20); // or min(my_agent, 10, 20);  } }   If the action doesn t have any operands, the syntax to use is my_agent the_action(). Finally, if it does not return a value, it might still be used but is considering as returning a value of type unknown (e.g. unknown result <- my_agent the_action(op1, op2);).  Note that due to the fact that actions are written by modelers, the general functional contract is not respected in that case: actions might perfectly have side effects on their operands (including the agent).

The pattern can use  %Y %M %N %D %E %h %m %s %z  for outputting years, months, name of month, days, name of days, hours, minutes, seconds and the time-zone. A null or empty pattern will parse the date using one of the ISO date & time formats (similar to date( … ) in that case). The pattern can also follow the pattern definition found here, which gives much more control over what will be parsed: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html#patterns. Different patterns are available by default as constant: #iso_local, #iso_simple, #iso_offset, #iso_zoned and #custom, which can be changed in the preferences  converts a string to a date following a custom pattern and a specific locale (e.g.  fr ,  en …).

The principle of the ELECTRE methods is to compare the possible candidates by pair. These methods analyses the possible outranking relation existing between two candidates. An candidate outranks another if this one is at least as good as the other one. The ELECTRE methods are based on two concepts: the concordance and the discordance. The concordance characterizes the fact that, for an outranking relation to be validated, a sufficient majority of criteria should be in favor of this assertion. The discordance characterizes the fact that, for an outranking relation to be validated, none of the criteria in the minority should oppose too strongly this assertion. These two conditions must be true for validating the outranking assertion. More information about the ELECTRE methods can be found in http://www.springerlink.com/content/g367r44322876223/ Figueira,  J., Mousseau, V., Roy, B.: ELECTRE Methods. In: Figueira, J., Greco, S., and Ehrgott, M., (Eds.), Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis: State of the Art Surveys, Springer, New York, 133–162 (2005). The first operand is the list of candidates (a candidate is a list of criterion values); the second operand the list of criterion: A criterion is a map that contains fives elements: a name, a weight, a preference value (p), an indifference value (q) and a veto value (v). The preference value represents the threshold from which the difference between two criterion values allows to prefer one vector of values over another. The indifference value represents the threshold from which the difference between two criterion values is considered significant. The veto value represents the threshold from which the difference between two criterion values disqualifies the candidate that obtained the smaller value; the last operand is the fuzzy cut.  Special cases:    returns -1 is the list of candidates is nil or empty   Examples:      int var0 <- electre_DM(1.0, 7.0,4.0,2.0,3.0, 3.0,  name :: utility ,  weight  :: 2.0, p ::0.5,  q ::0.0,  s ::1.0,  maximize  :: true, name :: price ,  weight  :: 1.0, p ::0.5,  q ::0.0,  s ::1.0,  maximize  :: false,0.7); // var0 equals 0       See also:  weighted_means_DM, promethee_DM, evidence_theory_DM,    ### ellipse  Possible use:    float ellipse float —>  geometry   ellipse (float , float) —>  geometry   Result: An ellipse geometry which x-radius is equal to the first operand and y-radius is equal to the second operand  Comment: the center of the ellipse is by default the location of the current agent in which has been called this operator.  Special cases:    returns a point if both operands are lower or equal to 0, a line if only one is.   Examples:      geometry var0 <- ellipse(10, 10); // var0 equals a geometry as an ellipse of width 10 and height 10.       See also:  around, cone, line, link, norm, point, polygon, polyline, rectangle, square, circle, squircle, triangle,    ### emotion  Possible use:    emotion (any) —>  emotion   Result: Casts the operand into the type emotion    ### empty  Possible use:    empty (container<KeyType,ValueType>) —>  bool   empty (string) —>  bool   Result: true if the operand is empty, false otherwise.  Comment: the empty operator behavior depends on the nature of the operand  Special cases:    if it is a map, empty returns true if the map contains no key-value mappings, and false otherwise   if it is a file, empty returns true if the content of the file (that is also a container) is empty, and false otherwise   if it is a population, empty returns true if there is no agent in the population, and false otherwise   if it is a graph, empty returns true if it contains no vertex and no edge, and false otherwise   if it is a matrix of int, float or object, it will return true if all elements are respectively 0, 0.0 or null, and false otherwise   if it is a matrix of geometry, it will return true if the matrix contains no cell, and false otherwise   if it is a list, empty returns true if there is no element in the list, and false otherwise        bool var0 <- empty(); // var0 equals true         if it is a string, empty returns true if the string does not contain any character, and false otherwise        bool var1 <- empty ( abced ); // var1 equals false        ### enlarged_by    Same signification as +    ### envelope  Possible use:    envelope (unknown) —>  geometry   Result: A 3D geometry that represents the box that surrounds the geometries or the surface described by the arguments. More general than geometry(arguments).envelope, as it allows to pass int, double, point, image files, shape files, asc files, or any list combining these arguments, in which case the envelope will be correctly expanded. If an envelope cannot be determined from the arguments, a default one of dimensions (0,100, 0, 100, 0, 100) is returned    ### eval_gaml  Possible use:    eval_gaml (string) —>  unknown   Result: evaluates the given GAML string.

Most of them use a classical prefixed functional syntax (i.e. operator_name(operand1, operand2, operand3), see below), with the exception of arithmetic (e.g. +, /), logical (and, or), comparison (e.g. >, <), access (., ..) and pair (::) operators, which require an infixed notation (i.e. operand1 operator_symbol operand1).  The ternary functional if-else operator, ? :, uses a special infixed syntax composed with two symbols (e.g. operand1 ? operand2 : operand3). Two unary operators (- and !) use a traditional prefixed syntax that does not require parentheses unless the operand is itself a complex expression (e.g.   - 10, ! (operand1 or operand2) ).  Finally, special constructor operators ({...} for constructing points, ... for constructing lists and maps) will require their operands to be placed between their two symbols (e.g. {1,2,3}, operand1, operand2, ..., operandn or key1::value1, key2::value2... keyn::valuen).  With the exception of these special cases above, the following rules apply to the syntax of operators: * if they only have one operand, the functional prefixed syntax is mandatory (e.g. operator_name(operand1)) * if they have two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. operator_name(operand1, operand2)) or the infixed syntax (e.g. operand1 operator_name operand2) can be used. * if they have more than two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. operator_name(operand1, operand2, ..., operand)) or a special infixed syntax with the first operand on the left-hand side of the operator name (e.g. operand1 operator_name(operand2, ..., operand)) can be used.  All of these alternative syntaxes are completely equivalent.  Operators in GAML are purely functional, i.e. they are guaranteed to not have any side effects on their operands. For instance, the shuffle operator, which randomizes the positions of elements in a list, does not modify its list operand but returns a new shuffled list.    Priority between operators  The priority of operators determines, in the case of complex expressions composed of several operators, which one(s) will be evaluated first.  GAML follows in general the traditional priorities attributed to arithmetic, boolean, comparison operators, with some twists. Namely: * the constructor operators, like ::, used to compose pairs of operands, have the lowest priority of all operators (e.g. a > b :: b > c will return a pair of boolean values, which means that the two comparisons are evaluated before the operator applies. Similarly, a > 10, b > 5 will return a list of boolean values. * it is followed by the ?: operator, the functional if-else (e.g.   a > b ? a + 10 : a - 10 will return the result of the if-else). * next are the logical operators, and and or (e.g. a > b or b > c will return the value of the test) * next are the comparison operators (i.e. >, <, <=, >=, =, !=) * next the arithmetic operators in their logical order (multiplicative operators have a higher priority than additive operators) * next the unary operators - and ! * next the access operators . and  (e.g. {1,2,3}.x > 20 + {4,5,6}.y  will return the result of the comparison between the x and y ordinates of the two points) * and finally the functional operators, which have the highest priority of all.    Using actions as operators  Actions defined in species can be used as operators, provided they are called on the correct agent. The syntax is that of normal functional operators, but the agent that will perform the action must be added as the first operand.  For instance, if the following species is defined:   species spec1 {  int min(int x, int y) {       return x > y ? x : y;  } }   Any agent instance of spec1 can use min as an operator (if the action conflicts with an existing operator, a warning will be emitted). For instance, in the same model, the following line is perfectly acceptable:   global {  init {       create spec1;       spec1 my_agent <- spec10;       int the_min <- my_agent min(10,20); // or min(my_agent, 10, 20);  } }   If the action doesn t have any operands, the syntax to use is my_agent the_action(). Finally, if it does not return a value, it might still be used but is considering as returning a value of type unknown (e.g. unknown result <- my_agent the_action(op1, op2);).  Note that due to the fact that actions are written by modelers, the general functional contract is not respected in that case: actions might perfectly have side effects on their operands (including the agent).

Special cases:    a list, containing all the agents of the same species than the left argument (if it is an agent) located at a distance inferior or equal to the third argument to the second argument (agent, geometry or point) considering the first operand topology.        list var3 <- neighbors_of (topology(self), self,10); // var3 equals all the agents located at a distance lower or equal to 10 to the agent applying the operator considering its topology.      Examples:      list var0 <- graphEpidemio neighbors_of (node(3)); // var0 equals node0,node2  list var1 <- graphFromMap neighbors_of node({12,45}); // var1 equals {1.0,5.0},{34.0,56.0}  list var2 <- topology(self) neighbors_of self; // var2 equals returns all the agents located at a distance lower or equal to 1 to the agent applying the operator considering its topology.

If this int parameter is equal to 0, the data is considered as already projected. opens a file that a is a kind of OSM file with some filtering.  Comment: The file should have a OSM file extension, cf. file type definition for supported file extensions.The file should have a OSM file extension, cf. file type definition for supported file extensions.  Special cases:    If the specified string does not refer to an existing OSM file, an exception is risen.   If the specified string does not refer to an existing OSM file, an exception is risen.   Examples:     file myOSMfile2 <- osm_file( ../includes/rouen.osm , highway :: primary , motorway , 0); file myOSMfile <- osm_file( ../includes/rouen.osm ,  highway :: primary , motorway );       See also:  file,    ### out_degree_of  Possible use:    graph out_degree_of unknown —>  int   out_degree_of (graph , unknown) —>  int   Result: returns the out degree of a vertex (right-hand operand) in the graph given as left-hand operand.

Extensions can represent new built-in species, types, file-types, skills, operators, statements, new control architectures or even types of displays. Other internal structures of GAML will be progressively  opened  to this mechanism in the future: display layers (hardwired for the moment), new types of outputs (hardwired for the moment), scheduling policies (hardwired for the moment), random number generators (hardwired for the moment). The extension mechanism relies on two complementary techniques:   * the first one consists in defining the GAML extensions in a plug-in (in the OSGI sense, see here) that will be loaded by GAMA at runtime and must  declare  that it is contributing to the platform.   * the second one is to indicate to GAMA where to look for extensions, using Java annotations that are gathered at compile time (some being also used at runtime) and directly compiled into GAML structures.

Do Not Edit It.    Definition  Operators in the GAML language are used to compose complex expressions. An operator performs a function on one, two, or n operands (which are other expressions and thus may be themselves composed of operators) and returns the result of this function.  Most of them use a classical prefixed functional syntax (i.e. operator_name(operand1, operand2, operand3), see below), with the exception of arithmetic (e.g. +, /), logical (and, or), comparison (e.g. >, <), access (., ..) and pair (::) operators, which require an infixed notation (i.e. operand1 operator_symbol operand1).  The ternary functional if-else operator, ? :, uses a special infixed syntax composed with two symbols (e.g. operand1 ? operand2 : operand3). Two unary operators (- and !) use a traditional prefixed syntax that does not require parentheses unless the operand is itself a complex expression (e.g.   - 10, ! (operand1 or operand2) ).  Finally, special constructor operators ({...} for constructing points, ... for constructing lists and maps) will require their operands to be placed between their two symbols (e.g. {1,2,3}, operand1, operand2, ..., operandn or key1::value1, key2::value2... keyn::valuen).  With the exception of these special cases above, the following rules apply to the syntax of operators: * if they only have one operand, the functional prefixed syntax is mandatory (e.g. operator_name(operand1)) * if they have two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. operator_name(operand1, operand2)) or the infixed syntax (e.g. operand1 operator_name operand2) can be used. * if they have more than two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. operator_name(operand1, operand2, ..., operand)) or a special infixed syntax with the first operand on the left-hand side of the operator name (e.g. operand1 operator_name(operand2, ..., operand)) can be used.  All of these alternative syntaxes are completely equivalent.  Operators in GAML are purely functional, i.e. they are guaranteed to not have any side effects on their operands. For instance, the shuffle operator, which randomizes the positions of elements in a list, does not modify its list operand but returns a new shuffled list.    Priority between operators  The priority of operators determines, in the case of complex expressions composed of several operators, which one(s) will be evaluated first.  GAML follows in general the traditional priorities attributed to arithmetic, boolean, comparison operators, with some twists. Namely: * the constructor operators, like ::, used to compose pairs of operands, have the lowest priority of all operators (e.g. a > b :: b > c will return a pair of boolean values, which means that the two comparisons are evaluated before the operator applies. Similarly, a > 10, b > 5 will return a list of boolean values. * it is followed by the ?: operator, the functional if-else (e.g.   a > b ? a + 10 : a - 10 will return the result of the if-else). * next are the logical operators, and and or (e.g. a > b or b > c will return the value of the test) * next are the comparison operators (i.e. >, <, <=, >=, =, !=) * next the arithmetic operators in their logical order (multiplicative operators have a higher priority than additive operators) * next the unary operators - and ! * next the access operators . and  (e.g. {1,2,3}.x > 20 + {4,5,6}.y  will return the result of the comparison between the x and y ordinates of the two points) * and finally the functional operators, which have the highest priority of all.    Using actions as operators  Actions defined in species can be used as operators, provided they are called on the correct agent. The syntax is that of normal functional operators, but the agent that will perform the action must be added as the first operand.  For instance, if the following species is defined:   species spec1 {  int min(int x, int y) {       return x > y ? x : y;  } }   Any agent instance of spec1 can use min as an operator (if the action conflicts with an existing operator, a warning will be emitted). For instance, in the same model, the following line is perfectly acceptable:   global {  init {       create spec1;       spec1 my_agent <- spec10;       int the_min <- my_agent min(10,20); // or min(my_agent, 10, 20);  } }   If the action doesn t have any operands, the syntax to use is my_agent the_action(). Finally, if it does not return a value, it might still be used but is considering as returning a value of type unknown (e.g. unknown result <- my_agent the_action(op1, op2);).  Note that due to the fact that actions are written by modelers, the general functional contract is not respected in that case: actions might perfectly have side effects on their operands (including the agent).

modellers, and computer scientists with a complete modelling and simulation development environment for building spatially explicit multi-agent simulations. It has been first developed by the Vietnamese-French research team MSI (located at IFI, Hanoi, and part of the IRD/UPMC International Research Unit UMMISCO) from 2007 to 2010, and is now developed by a consortium of academic and industrial partners led by UMMISCO, among which the University of Rouen, France, the University of Toulouse 1, France, the University of Orsay, France, the University of Can Tho, Vietnam, the National University of Hanoi, EDF R&D, France, and CEA LISC, France.    Some of the features of GAMA are illustrated in the videos above (more can be found in our Youtube channel).  Beyond these features, GAMA also offers:     A complete modeling language, GAML, for modeling agents and environments   A large and extensible library of primitives (agent s movement, communication, mathematical functions, graphical features, …)   A cross-platform reproducibility of experiments and simulations   A powerful declarative drawing and plotting subsystem   A flexible user interface based on the Eclipse platform   A complete set of batch tools, allowing for a systematic or  intelligent  exploration of models parameters spaces   Documentation The documentation of GAMA is available online on the wiki of the project. It is organized around a few central activities (installing GAMA, writing models, running experiments, developing new extensions to the platform) and provides complete references on both the GAML language, the platform itself, and the scientific aspects of our work (with a complete bibliography). Several tutorials are also provided in the documentation in order to minimize the learning curve, allowing users to build, step by step, the models corresponding to these tutorials, which are of course shipped with the platform.  The documentation can be accessed from the side bar of this page. A good starting point for new users is the installation page.  A standalone version of the documentation, in PDF format, can be directly downloaded here  Source Code GAMA can be downloaded as a regular application or built from source, which is necessary if you want to contribute to the platform. The source code is available from this GITHub repository:   https://github.com/gama-platform/gama   Which you can also browse from the web here. It is, in any case, recommended to follow the instructions on this page in order to build GAMA from source.

","url":"wiki/Overview.md"},{"id":"wiki/OperatorsAA.md","title":" Operators (A to A)","content":"Operators (A to A)    This file is automatically generated from java files. Do Not Edit It.    Definition  Operators in the GAML language are used to compose complex expressions. An operator performs a function on one, two, or n operands (which are other expressions and thus may be themselves composed of operators) and returns the result of this function.  Most of them use a classical prefixed functional syntax (i.e. operator_name(operand1, operand2, operand3), see below), with the exception of arithmetic (e.g. +, /), logical (and, or), comparison (e.g. >, <), access (., ..) and pair (::) operators, which require an infixed notation (i.e. operand1 operator_symbol operand1).  The ternary functional if-else operator, ? :, uses a special infixed syntax composed with two symbols (e.g. operand1 ? operand2 : operand3). Two unary operators (- and !) use a traditional prefixed syntax that does not require parentheses unless the operand is itself a complex expression (e.g.   - 10, ! (operand1 or operand2) ).  Finally, special constructor operators ({...} for constructing points, ... for constructing lists and maps) will require their operands to be placed between their two symbols (e.g. {1,2,3}, operand1, operand2, ..., operandn or key1::value1, key2::value2... keyn::valuen).  With the exception of these special cases above, the following rules apply to the syntax of operators: * if they only have one operand, the functional prefixed syntax is mandatory (e.g. operator_name(operand1)) * if they have two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. operator_name(operand1, operand2)) or the infixed syntax (e.g. operand1 operator_name operand2) can be used. * if they have more than two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. operator_name(operand1, operand2, ..., operand)) or a special infixed syntax with the first operand on the left-hand side of the operator name (e.g. operand1 operator_name(operand2, ..., operand)) can be used.  All of these alternative syntaxes are completely equivalent.  Operators in GAML are purely functional, i.e. they are guaranteed to not have any side effects on their operands. For instance, the shuffle operator, which randomizes the positions of elements in a list, does not modify its list operand but returns a new shuffled list.    Priority between operators  The priority of operators determines, in the case of complex expressions composed of several operators, which one(s) will be evaluated first.  GAML follows in general the traditional priorities attributed to arithmetic, boolean, comparison operators, with some twists. Namely: * the constructor operators, like ::, used to compose pairs of operands, have the lowest priority of all operators (e.g. a > b :: b > c will return a pair of boolean values, which means that the two comparisons are evaluated before the operator applies. Similarly, a > 10, b > 5 will return a list of boolean values. * it is followed by the ?: operator, the functional if-else (e.g.   a > b ? a + 10 : a - 10 will return the result of the if-else). * next are the logical operators, and and or (e.g. a > b or b > c will return the value of the test) * next are the comparison operators (i.e. >, <, <=, >=, =, !=) * next the arithmetic operators in their logical order (multiplicative operators have a higher priority than additive operators) * next the unary operators - and ! * next the access operators . and  (e.g. {1,2,3}.x > 20 + {4,5,6}.y  will return the result of the comparison between the x and y ordinates of the two points) * and finally the functional operators, which have the highest priority of all.    Using actions as operators  Actions defined in species can be used as operators, provided they are called on the correct agent. The syntax is that of normal functional operators, but the agent that will perform the action must be added as the first operand.  For instance, if the following species is defined:   species spec1 {  int min(int x, int y) {       return x > y ? x : y;  } }   Any agent instance of spec1 can use min as an operator (if the action conflicts with an existing operator, a warning will be emitted). For instance, in the same model, the following line is perfectly acceptable:   global {  init {       create spec1;       spec1 my_agent <- spec10;       int the_min <- my_agent min(10,20); // or min(my_agent, 10, 20);  } }   If the action doesn t have any operands, the syntax to use is my_agent the_action(). Finally, if it does not return a value, it might still be used but is considering as returning a value of type unknown (e.g. unknown result <- my_agent the_action(op1, op2);).  Note that due to the fact that actions are written by modelers, the general functional contract is not respected in that case: actions might perfectly have side effects on their operands (including the agent).

Better to use  until  or  before  in that case every(2#days) after (starting_date + 1#day)  // the computation will return true every two days (using the starting_date of the model as the starting point) only for the dates strictly after this starting_date + 1#day         ### agent  Possible use:    agent (any) —>  agent   Result: Casts the operand into the type agent    ### agent_closest_to  Possible use:    agent_closest_to (unknown) —>  agent   Result: An agent, the closest to the operand (casted as a geometry).

Examples:      list var0 <- agents_at_distance(20); // var0 equals all the agents (excluding the caller) which distance to the caller is lower than 20       See also:  neighbors_at, neighbors_of, agent_closest_to, agents_inside, closest_to, inside, overlapping, at_distance,    ### agents_inside  Possible use:    agents_inside (unknown) —>  list<agent>   Result: A list of agents covered by the operand (casted as a geometry).

Comment: The function atan2 is the arctangent function with two arguments. The purpose of using two arguments instead of one is to gather information on the signs of the inputs in order to return the appropriate quadrant of the computed angle, which is not possible for the single-argument arctangent function.  Examples:      float var0 <- atan2 (0,0); // var0 equals 0.0       See also:  atan, acos, asin,    ### attributes  Possible use:    attributes (any) —>  attributes   Result: Casts the operand into the type attributes    ### auto_correlation  Possible use:    container auto_correlation int —>  float   auto_correlation (container , int) —>  float   Result: Returns the auto-correlation of a data sequence ","url":"wiki/OperatorsAA.md"},{"id":"wiki/GamlLanguage.md","title":" GAML","content":"GAML  Models that users want to simulate in GAMA have to be written in a special language, called GAML (short for GAma Modeling Language)  GAML is born from the necessity to have a high-level declarative way of defining and reusing structures found in almost all agent-based models. See here for more information about its background.  Although this choice requires users to learn a new programming (or better, modeling) language, everything has been made in GAMA to support a short learning curve, so that they can become almost autonomous in a limited time (informal measures taken at the different events centered on GAMA have shown that one day is enough to acquire sufficient skills in writing complete models in GAML).  The documentation on GAML is organized in 5 main points:     Description of the general structure of a model: see this page   Description of the declaration of species (and all their components): see this page and all its subpages   Description of the declaration of experiments: see this page for regular experiments and this one for batch experiments.

A model is nothing more than a text file (or a collection of text files that refer to each other), which contains instructions in a specific language called GAML (for  GAMA Modeling Language ). A model can then be theoretically edited using any text processor and later loaded into GAMA to run experiments. However, because of the richness of the language, using a dedicated tool (with online help, live validation) is clearly the best way to write correct models.  The GUI version of GAMA offers such an integrated model development environment, which is composed of a set of coupled tools to support modelers in the edition, validation, and management of models. An optional graphical modeling editor can also be installed on top of these tools to support higher-level modeling activities (similar to what a UML editor with Java bindings may provide to a Java development environment).

Do Not Edit It.    Definition  Operators in the GAML language are used to compose complex expressions. An operator performs a function on one, two, or n operands (which are other expressions and thus may be themselves composed of operators) and returns the result of this function.  Most of them use a classical prefixed functional syntax (i.e. operator_name(operand1, operand2, operand3), see below), with the exception of arithmetic (e.g. +, /), logical (and, or), comparison (e.g. >, <), access (., ..) and pair (::) operators, which require an infixed notation (i.e. operand1 operator_symbol operand1).  The ternary functional if-else operator, ? :, uses a special infixed syntax composed with two symbols (e.g. operand1 ? operand2 : operand3). Two unary operators (- and !) use a traditional prefixed syntax that does not require parentheses unless the operand is itself a complex expression (e.g.   - 10, ! (operand1 or operand2) ).  Finally, special constructor operators ({...} for constructing points, ... for constructing lists and maps) will require their operands to be placed between their two symbols (e.g. {1,2,3}, operand1, operand2, ..., operandn or key1::value1, key2::value2... keyn::valuen).  With the exception of these special cases above, the following rules apply to the syntax of operators: * if they only have one operand, the functional prefixed syntax is mandatory (e.g. operator_name(operand1)) * if they have two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. operator_name(operand1, operand2)) or the infixed syntax (e.g. operand1 operator_name operand2) can be used. * if they have more than two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. operator_name(operand1, operand2, ..., operand)) or a special infixed syntax with the first operand on the left-hand side of the operator name (e.g. operand1 operator_name(operand2, ..., operand)) can be used.  All of these alternative syntaxes are completely equivalent.  Operators in GAML are purely functional, i.e. they are guaranteed to not have any side effects on their operands. For instance, the shuffle operator, which randomizes the positions of elements in a list, does not modify its list operand but returns a new shuffled list.    Priority between operators  The priority of operators determines, in the case of complex expressions composed of several operators, which one(s) will be evaluated first.  GAML follows in general the traditional priorities attributed to arithmetic, boolean, comparison operators, with some twists. Namely: * the constructor operators, like ::, used to compose pairs of operands, have the lowest priority of all operators (e.g. a > b :: b > c will return a pair of boolean values, which means that the two comparisons are evaluated before the operator applies. Similarly, a > 10, b > 5 will return a list of boolean values. * it is followed by the ?: operator, the functional if-else (e.g.   a > b ? a + 10 : a - 10 will return the result of the if-else). * next are the logical operators, and and or (e.g. a > b or b > c will return the value of the test) * next are the comparison operators (i.e. >, <, <=, >=, =, !=) * next the arithmetic operators in their logical order (multiplicative operators have a higher priority than additive operators) * next the unary operators - and ! * next the access operators . and  (e.g. {1,2,3}.x > 20 + {4,5,6}.y  will return the result of the comparison between the x and y ordinates of the two points) * and finally the functional operators, which have the highest priority of all.    Using actions as operators  Actions defined in species can be used as operators, provided they are called on the correct agent. The syntax is that of normal functional operators, but the agent that will perform the action must be added as the first operand.  For instance, if the following species is defined:   species spec1 {  int min(int x, int y) {       return x > y ? x : y;  } }   Any agent instance of spec1 can use min as an operator (if the action conflicts with an existing operator, a warning will be emitted). For instance, in the same model, the following line is perfectly acceptable:   global {  init {       create spec1;       spec1 my_agent <- spec10;       int the_min <- my_agent min(10,20); // or min(my_agent, 10, 20);  } }   If the action doesn t have any operands, the syntax to use is my_agent the_action(). Finally, if it does not return a value, it might still be used but is considering as returning a value of type unknown (e.g. unknown result <- my_agent the_action(op1, op2);).  Note that due to the fact that actions are written by modelers, the general functional contract is not respected in that case: actions might perfectly have side effects on their operands (including the agent).

Two other forms (with a directory and a map<string, string> of environment variables) are available.    ### cone  Possible use:    cone (point) —>  geometry   int cone int —>  geometry   cone (int , int) —>  geometry   Result: A cone geometry which min and max angles are given by the operands.

Do Not Edit It.    Definition  Operators in the GAML language are used to compose complex expressions. An operator performs a function on one, two, or n operands (which are other expressions and thus may be themselves composed of operators) and returns the result of this function.  Most of them use a classical prefixed functional syntax (i.e. operator_name(operand1, operand2, operand3), see below), with the exception of arithmetic (e.g. +, /), logical (and, or), comparison (e.g. >, <), access (., ..) and pair (::) operators, which require an infixed notation (i.e. operand1 operator_symbol operand1).  The ternary functional if-else operator, ? :, uses a special infixed syntax composed with two symbols (e.g. operand1 ? operand2 : operand3). Two unary operators (- and !) use a traditional prefixed syntax that does not require parentheses unless the operand is itself a complex expression (e.g.   - 10, ! (operand1 or operand2) ).  Finally, special constructor operators ({...} for constructing points, ... for constructing lists and maps) will require their operands to be placed between their two symbols (e.g. {1,2,3}, operand1, operand2, ..., operandn or key1::value1, key2::value2... keyn::valuen).  With the exception of these special cases above, the following rules apply to the syntax of operators: * if they only have one operand, the functional prefixed syntax is mandatory (e.g. operator_name(operand1)) * if they have two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. operator_name(operand1, operand2)) or the infixed syntax (e.g. operand1 operator_name operand2) can be used. * if they have more than two arguments, either the functional prefixed syntax (e.g. operator_name(operand1, operand2, ..., operand)) or a special infixed syntax with the first operand on the left-hand side of the operator name (e.g. operand1 operator_name(operand2, ..., operand)) can be used.  All of these alternative syntaxes are completely equivalent.  Operators in GAML are purely functional, i.e. they are guaranteed to not have any side effects on their operands. For instance, the shuffle operator, which randomizes the positions of elements in a list, does not modify its list operand but returns a new shuffled list.    Priority between operators  The priority of operators determines, in the case of complex expressions composed of several operators, which one(s) will be evaluated first.  GAML follows in general the traditional priorities attributed to arithmetic, boolean, comparison operators, with some twists. Namely: * the constructor operators, like ::, used to compose pairs of operands, have the lowest priority of all operators (e.g. a > b :: b > c will return a pair of boolean values, which means that the two comparisons are evaluated before the operator applies. Similarly, a > 10, b > 5 will return a list of boolean values. * it is followed by the ?: operator, the functional if-else (e.g.   a > b ? a + 10 : a - 10 will return the result of the if-else). * next are the logical operators, and and or (e.g. a > b or b > c will return the value of the test) * next are the comparison operators (i.e. >, <, <=, >=, =, !=) * next the arithmetic operators in their logical order (multiplicative operators have a higher priority than additive operators) * next the unary operators - and ! * next the access operators . and  (e.g. {1,2,3}.x > 20 + {4,5,6}.y  will return the result of the comparison between the x and y ordinates of the two points) * and finally the functional operators, which have the highest priority of all.    Using actions as operators  Actions defined in species can be used as operators, provided they are called on the correct agent. The syntax is that of normal functional operators, but the agent that will perform the action must be added as the first operand.  For instance, if the following species is defined:   species spec1 {  int min(int x, int y) {       return x > y ? x : y;  } }   Any agent instance of spec1 can use min as an operator (if the action conflicts with an existing operator, a warning will be emitted). For instance, in the same model, the following line is perfectly acceptable:   global {  init {       create spec1;       spec1 my_agent <- spec10;       int the_min <- my_agent min(10,20); // or min(my_agent, 10, 20);  } }   If the action doesn t have any operands, the syntax to use is my_agent the_action(). Finally, if it does not return a value, it might still be used but is considering as returning a value of type unknown (e.g. unknown result <- my_agent the_action(op1, op2);).  Note that due to the fact that actions are written by modelers, the general functional contract is not respected in that case: actions might perfectly have side effects on their operands (including the agent).

See also:  rotated_by, translated_by,    ### translated_by  Possible use:    geometry translated_by point —>  geometry   translated_by (geometry , point) —>  geometry   Result: A geometry resulting from the application of a translation by the right-hand operand distance to the left-hand operand (geometry, agent, point)  Examples:      geometry var0 <- self translated_by {10,10,10}; // var0 equals the geometry resulting from applying the translation to the left-hand geometry (or agent).

Comment: the center of the triangle is by default the location of the current agent in which has been called this operator.  Special cases:    returns nil if the operand is nil.   Examples:      geometry var0 <- triangle(5); // var0 equals a geometry as a triangle with side_size = 5.

Special cases:    when the operand is a point, it is read as {mean, standardDeviation}   if the operand is a list, only the two first elements are taken into account as mean, standardDeviation   when truncated_gauss is called with a list of only one element mean, it will always return 0.0   Examples:      float var0 <- truncated_gauss ({0, 0.3}); // var0 equals a float between -0.3 and 0.3  float var1 <- truncated_gauss (0.5, 0.0); // var1 equals 0.5       See also:  gauss,    ### type_of  Possible use:    type_of (unknown) —>  msi.gaml.types.IType<?>     ### undirected  Possible use:    undirected (graph) —>  graph   Result: the operand graph becomes an undirected graph.  Comment: the operator alters the operand graph, it does not create a new one.  See also:  directed,    ### union  Possible use:    union (container<geometry>) —>  geometry   container union container —>  list   union (container , container) —>  list   Result: returns a new list containing all the elements of both containers without duplicated elements.  Special cases:    if the left or right operand is nil, union throws an error   if the right-operand is a container of points, geometries or agents, returns the geometry resulting from the union all the geometries   Examples:      list var0 <- 1,2,3,4,5,6 union 2,4,9; // var0 equals 1,2,3,4,5,6,9  list var1 <- 1,2,3,4,5,6 union 0,8; // var1 equals 1,2,3,4,5,6,0,8  list var2 <- 1,3,2,4,5,6,8,5,6 union 0,8; // var2 equals 1,3,2,4,5,6,8,0  geometry var3 <- union(geom1, geom2, geom3); // var3 equals a geometry corresponding to union between geom1, geom2 and geom3       See also:  inter, +,    ### unknown  Possible use:    unknown (any) —>  unknown   Result: Casts the operand into the type unknown    ### until  Possible use:    until (date) —>  bool   any expression until date —>  bool   until (any expression , date) —>  bool   Result: Returns true if the current_date of the model is before (or equel to) the date passed in argument. Synonym of  current_date <= argument   Examples:     reflex when: until(starting_date) {}  // This reflex will be run only once at the beginning of the simulation         ### upper_case  Possible use:    upper_case (string) —>  string   Result: Converts all of the characters in the string operand to upper case  Examples:      string var0 <- upper_case( Abc ); // var0 equals  ABC        See also:  lower_case,    ### URL_file  Possible use:    URL_file (string) —>  file   Result: Constructs a file of type URL.

Comment: the operator alters the operand graph, it does not create a new one.  See also:  path_between,    ### user_input  Possible use:    user_input (any expression) —>  map<string,unknown>   string user_input any expression —>  map<string,unknown>   user_input (string , any expression) —>  map<string,unknown>   Result: asks the user for some values (not defined as parameters). Takes a string (optional) and a map as arguments. The string is used to specify the message of the dialog box. The map is to specify the parameters you want the user to change before the simulation starts, with the name of the parameter in string key, and the default value as value.  Comment: This operator takes a map string::value as argument, displays a dialog asking the user for these values, and returns the same map with the modified values (if any). The dialog is modal and will interrupt the execution of the simulation until the user has either dismissed or accepted it. It can be used, for instance, in an init section to force the user to input new values instead of relying on the initial values of parameters :  Examples:     map<string,unknown> values2 <- user_input( Enter numer of agents and locations , Number  :: 100,  Location  :: {10, 10}); create bug number: int(values2 at  Number ) with: location:: (point(values2 at  Location )); map<string,unknown> values <- user_input( Number  :: 100,  Location  :: {10, 10}); create bug number: int(values at  Number ) with: location:: (point(values at  Location ));         ### using  Possible use:    any expression using topology —>  unknown   using (any expression , topology) —>  unknown   Result: Allows to specify in which topology a spatial computation should take place.  Special cases:    has no effect if the topology passed as a parameter is nil   Examples:      unknown var0 <- (agents closest_to self) using topology(world); // var0 equals the closest agent to self (the caller) in the continuous topology of the world         ### variance  Possible use:    variance (container) —>  float   Result: the variance of the elements of the operand. See Variance for more details.  Comment: The operator casts all the numerical element of the list into float. The elements that are not numerical are discarded.  Examples:      float var0 <- variance (4.5, 3.5, 5.5, 7.0); // var0 equals 1.671875       See also:  mean, median,    ### variance  Possible use:    variance (float) —>  float   variance (int, float, float) —>  float   Result: Returns the variance of a data sequence. That is (sumOfSquares - mean*sum) / size with mean = sum/size. Returns the variance from a standard deviation.    ### variance_of  Possible use:    container variance_of any expression —>  unknown   variance_of (container , any expression) —>  unknown   Result: the variance of the right-hand expression evaluated on each of the elements of the left-hand operand  Comment: in the right-hand operand, the keyword each can be used to represent, in turn, each of the right-hand operand elements.  See also:  min_of, max_of, sum_of, product_of,    ### vertical  Possible use:    vertical (msi.gama.util.GamaMap<java.lang.Object,java.lang.Integer>) —>  msi.gama.util.tree.GamaNode<java.lang.String>     ### voronoi  Possible use:    voronoi (list<point>) —>  list<geometry>   list<point> voronoi geometry —>  list<geometry>   voronoi (list<point> , geometry) —>  list<geometry>   Result: A list of geometries corresponding to the Voronoi diagram built from the list of points according to the given clip A list of geometries corresponding to the Voronoi diagram built from the list of points  Examples:      list var0 <- voronoi({10,10},{50,50},{90,90},{10,90},{90,10}, square(300)); // var0 equals the list of geometries corresponding to the Voronoi Diagram built from the list of points with a square of 300m side size as clip.  list var1 <- voronoi({10,10},{50,50},{90,90},{10,90},{90,10}); // var1 equals the list of geometries corresponding to the Voronoi Diagram built from the list of points.         ### weight_of  Possible use:    graph weight_of unknown —>  float   weight_of (graph , unknown) —>  float   Result: returns the weight of the given edge (right-hand operand) contained in the graph given in right-hand operand.  Comment: In a localized graph, an edge has a weight by default (the distance between both vertices).  Special cases:    if the left-operand (the graph) is nil, returns nil   if the right-hand operand is not an edge of the given graph, weight_of checks whether it is a node of the graph and tries to return its weight   if the right-hand operand is neither a node, nor an edge, returns 1.   Examples:     graph graphFromMap <-  as_edge_graph({1,5}::{12,45},{12,45}::{34,56}); float var1 <- graphFromMap weight_of(link({1,5},{12,45})); // var1 equals 1.0         ### weighted_means_DM  Possible use:    msi.gama.util.IList<java.util.List> weighted_means_DM msi.gama.util.IList<java.util.Map<java.lang.String,java.lang.Object>> —>  int   weighted_means_DM (msi.gama.util.IList<java.util.List> , msi.gama.util.IList<java.util.Map<java.lang.String,java.lang.Object>>) —>  int   Result: The index of the candidate that maximizes the weighted mean of its criterion values. The first operand is the list of candidates (a candidate is a list of criterion values); the second operand the list of criterion (list of map)  Special cases:    returns -1 is the list of candidates is nil or empty   Examples:      int var0 <- weighted_means_DM(1.0, 7.0,4.0,2.0,3.0, 3.0,  name :: utility ,  weight  :: 2.0, name :: price ,  weight  :: 1.0); // var0 equals 1       See also:  promethee_DM, electre_DM, evidence_theory_DM,    ### where  Possible use:    container where any expression —>  list   where (container , any expression) —>  list   Result: a list containing all the elements of the left-hand operand that make the right-hand operand evaluate to true.  Comment: in the right-hand operand, the keyword each can be used to represent, in turn, each of the right-hand operand elements.  Special cases:    if the left-hand operand is a list nil, where returns a new empty list   if the left-operand is a map, the keyword each will contain each value        list var4 <- 1::2, 3::4, 5::6 where (each >= 4); // var4 equals 4, 6      Examples:      list var0 <- 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 where (each > 3); // var0 equals 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 list var2 <- g2 where (length(g2 out_edges_of each) = 0 ); // var2 equals node9, node7, node10, node8, node11  list var3 <- (list(node) where (round(node(each).location.x) > 32); // var3 equals node2, node3       See also:  first_with, last_with, where,    ### with_lifetime  Possible use:    predicate with_lifetime int —>  predicate   with_lifetime (predicate , int) —>  predicate   Result: change the parameters of the given predicate  Examples:     predicate with_lifetime 10         ### with_max_of  Possible use:    container with_max_of any expression —>  unknown   with_max_of (container , any expression) —>  unknown   Result: one of elements of the left-hand operand that maximizes the value of the right-hand operand  Comment: in the right-hand operand, the keyword each can be used to represent, in turn, each of the right-hand operand elements.  Special cases:    if the left-hand operand is nil, with_max_of returns the default value of the right-hand operand   Examples:      unknown var0 <- 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 with_max_of (each ); // var0 equals 8  unknown var2 <- g2 with_max_of (length(g2 out_edges_of each)  ) ; // var2 equals node4  unknown var3 <- (list(node) with_max_of (round(node(each).location.x)); // var3 equals node3  unknown var4 <- 1::2, 3::4, 5::6 with_max_of (each); // var4 equals 6       See also:  where, with_min_of,    ### with_min_of  Possible use:    container with_min_of any expression —>  unknown   with_min_of (container , any expression) —>  unknown   Result: one of elements of the left-hand operand that minimizes the value of the right-hand operand  Comment: in the right-hand operand, the keyword each can be used to represent, in turn, each of the right-hand operand elements.  Special cases:    if the left-hand operand is nil, with_max_of returns the default value of the right-hand operand   Examples:      unknown var0 <- 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 with_min_of (each ); // var0 equals 1  unknown var2 <- g2 with_min_of (length(g2 out_edges_of each)  ); // var2 equals node11  unknown var3 <- (list(node) with_min_of (round(node(each).location.x)); // var3 equals node0  unknown var4 <- 1::2, 3::4, 5::6 with_min_of (each); // var4 equals 2       See also:  where, with_max_of,    ### with_optimizer_type  Possible use:    graph with_optimizer_type string —>  graph   with_optimizer_type (graph , string) —>  graph   Result: changes the shortest path computation method of the given graph  Comment: the right-hand operand can be  Djikstra ,  Bellmann ,  Astar  to use the associated algorithm. Note that these methods are dynamic: the path is computed when needed. In contrarily, if the operand is another string, a static method will be used, i.e. all the shortest are previously computed.  Examples:     graphEpidemio <- graphEpidemio with_optimizer_type  static ;       See also:  set_verbose,    ### with_precision  Possible use:    float with_precision int —>  float   with_precision (float , int) —>  float   point with_precision int —>  point   with_precision (point , int) —>  point   geometry with_precision int —>  geometry   with_precision (geometry , int) —>  geometry   Result: Rounds off the value of left-hand operand to the precision given by the value of right-hand operand Rounds off the ordinates of the left-hand point to the precision given by the value of right-hand operand A geometry corresponding to the rounding of points of the operand considering a given precison.

See also:  round,    ### with_values  Possible use:    predicate with_values map —>  predicate   with_values (predicate , map) —>  predicate   Result: change the parameters of the given predicate  Examples:     predicate with_values  time ::10         ### with_weights  Possible use:    graph with_weights list —>  graph   with_weights (graph , list) —>  graph   graph with_weights map —>  graph   with_weights (graph , map) —>  graph   Result: returns the graph (left-hand operand) with weight given in the map (right-hand operand).  Comment: this operand re-initializes the path finder  Special cases:    if the right-hand operand is a list, affects the n elements of the list to the n first edges. Note that the ordering of edges may change overtime, which can create some problems…   if the left-hand operand is a map, the map should contains pairs such as: vertex/edge::double    graph_from_edges (list(ant) as_map each::one_of (list(ant))) with_weights (list(ant) as_map each::each.food)      ### without_holes  Possible use:    without_holes (geometry) —>  geometry   Result: A geometry corresponding to the operand geometry (geometry, agent, point) without its holes  Examples:      geometry var0 <- solid(self); // var0 equals the geometry corresponding to the geometry of the agent applying the operator without its holes.         ### writable  Possible use:    file writable bool —>  file   writable (file , bool) —>  file   Result: Marks the file as read-only or not, depending on the second boolean argument, and returns the first argument  Comment: A file is created using its native flags. This operator can change them. Beware that this change is system-wide (and not only restrained to GAMA): changing a file to read-only mode (e.g.  writable(f, false) )  Examples:      file var0 <- shape_file( ../images/point_eau.shp ) writable false; // var0 equals returns a file in read-only mode       See also:  file,    ### xml_file  Possible use:    xml_file (string) —>  file   Result: Constructs a file of type xml. Allowed extensions are limited to xml    ### xor  Possible use:    bool xor bool —>  bool   xor (bool , bool) —>  bool   Result: a bool value, equal to the logical xor between the left-hand operand and the right-hand operand.

See also:  or, and, !,    ### years_between  Possible use:    date years_between date —>  int   years_between (date , date) —>  int   Result: Provide the exact number of years between two dates. This number can be positive or negative (if the second operand is smaller than the first one)  Examples:      int var0 <- years_between(date( 2000-01-01 ), date( 2010-01-01 )); // var0 equals 10       ","url":"wiki/OperatorsSZ.md"},{"id":"wiki/NewVersionChanges.md","title":" Java version","content":"Java version  Due to changes in the libraries used by GAMA 1.7 and 1.8, this version now requires JDK/JVM 1.8 to run. Please note that GAMA has not been tested with JDK 1.9 and 1.10.  Changes between 1.6.1 and 1.7/1.8 that can influence the dynamics of models     Initialization order between the initialization of variables and the execution of the init block in grids init -> vars in 1.6.1 / vars -> init in 1.7   Initialization order of agents -> now, the init block of the agents are not executed at the end of the global init, but during it. put a sample model to explain the order of creation and its differences   Initialization of vars to their default value map ? list ?   Systematic casting and verification of types give examples   header of CSV files: be careful, in GAMA 1.7, if the first line is detected as a header, it is not read when the file is casted as a matrix (so the first row of the matrix is not the header, but the first line of data) gives examples   the step of batch experiments is now executed after all repetitions of simulations are done (not after each one). They can however be still accessed using the attributes simulations (see Batch.gaml in Models Library)   signal and diffuse have been merged into a single statement   facets do not accept a space between their identifier and the : anymore.   simplification of equation/solve statements and deprecation of old facets   in FIPA skill, contentis replaced everywhere with contents   in FIPA skill, receivers is replaced everywhere with to   in FIPA skill, messages is replaced by mailbox   The pseudo-attribute user_location has been removed (not deprecated, unfortunately) and replaced by the  unit  #user_location.   The actions called by an event layer do not need anymore to define point and list<agent> arguments to receive the mouse location and the list of agents selected. Instead, they can now use #user_location and they have to compute the selected agents by themselves (using an arbitrary function).   The random number generators now better handle seeding (larger range), but it can change the series of values previously obtained from a given seed in 1.6.1   all models now have a starting_date and a current_date. They then dont begin at an hypothetical  zero  date, but at the epoch date defined by ISO 8601 (1970/1/1). It should not change models that dont rely on dates, except that:   the #year (and its nicknames #y, #years) and #month (and its nickname #month) do not longer have a default value (of resp. 30 days and 360 days). Instead, they are always evaluated against the current_date of the model. If no starting_date is defined, the values of #month and #year will then depend on the sequence of months and year since epoch day.   as_time, as_system_time, as_date and as_system_date have been removed   Enhancements in 1.7/1.8  Simulations    simulations can now be run in parallel withing an experiment (with their outputs, displays, etc.)   batch experiments inherit from this possibility and can now run their repetitions in parallel too.   concurrency between agents is now possible and can be controlled on a species/grid/ask basis (from multi-threaded concurrency to complete parallelism within a species/grid or between the targets of an ask statement)   Language    gama : a new immutable agent that can be invoked to change preferences or access to platform-only properties (like machine-time)   abort: a new behavior (like reflex or init) that is executed once when the agent is about to die   try and catch statements now provide a robust way to catch errors happening in the simulations.   super (instead of self) and invoke (instead of do) can now be used to call an action defined in a parent species.   date : new data type that offers the possibility to use a real calendar, to define a starting_date and to query a current_date from a simulation, to parse dates from date files or to output them in custom formats. Dates can be added, subtracted, compared. Various new operators (minus_months, etc.) allow for a fine manipulation of their data. Time units (#sec, #s, #mn, #minute, #h, #hour, #day, etc.) can be used in conjunction with them. Interval of dates (date1 to date2) can be created and used as a basis for loops, etc. Various simple operators allow for defining conditions based on the current_date (after(date1), before(date2), since(date1), etc.).   font type allows to define fonts more precisely in draw statements   BDI control architecture for agents   file management, new operators, new statements, new skills(?), new built-in variables, files can now download their contents from the web by using standard http: https: addresses instead of file paths.

In addition, a new facet attributes allows to define complex attributes to be saved.   assert has a simpler syntax and can be used in any behaviour to raise an error if a condition is not met.   test is a new type of experiments (experiment aaa type: test ... ), equivalent to a batch with an exhaustive search method, which automatically displays the status of tests found in the model.   new operators (sum_of, product_of, etc.)   casting of files works   co-modeling (importation of micro-models that can be managed within a macro-model)   populations of agents can now be easily exported to CSV files using the save statement   Simple messaging skill between agents   Terminal commands can now be issued from within GAMA using the console operator   New status statement allows to change the text of the status.   light statement in 3D display provides the possibility to custom your lights (point lights, direction lights, spot lights)   Displays can now inherit from other displays (facets parent and virtual to describe abstract displays)   on_change: facet for attributes/parameters allows to define a sequence of statements to run whenever the value changes.   species and experiment now support the virtual boolean facet (virtual species can not be instantiated, and virtual experiments do not show up).   experiment now supports the auto_run boolean facet (to run automatically when launched)   experiment now supports the benchmark boolean facet (to produce a CSV summary of the time spent in the different statements / operators of GAMA)   experiments can now have their own file (xxx.experiment) and specify the model they are targeting by providing the path to the model in the new model: facet (similar to import).   experiments can sport a new type: test, a specialised type of batch experiment that can be run automatically from the GUI or in headless and reports back the result of the tests found in its model   Data importation    draw of complex shapes through obj file   new types fo files are taken into account: geotiff and dxf   viewers for common files   addition of plugin and test models   Navigator    Shapefiles are now copied, pasted and deleted together with their support files   External files are automatically linked from the workspace and the links are filed under an automatically created external folder in the project   The  Refresh  command in the navigator pop-up refreshes the files, cleans the metadata and recompiles the models in order to obtain a  fresh  workspace again   A search control allows to instantaneously find models based on their names (not contents)   Wizards for creating .experiment file and test experiments   The new project Wizard now leads by default to the new file wizard   Editor    doc on built-in elements, templates, shortcuts to common tasks, hyperlinks to files used   improvement in time, gathering of infos/todos   warnings can be removed from model files   resources / files can be dropped into editors to obtain declaration/import of the corresponding files   Headless    A new option -validate path/to/dir allows to run a complete validation of all the models in the directory   A new option -test path/to/dir allows to run all the tests defined in a directory   Models library:    New models (make a list)   Preferences    For performances and bug fixes in displays   For charts defaults   Simulation displays    OpenGL displays should be up to 3 times faster in rendering   fullscreen mode for displays (ESC key)   CTRL+O for overlay and CTRL+L for layers side controls   cleaner OpenGL displays (less garbage, better drawing of lines, rotation helper, sticky ROI, etc.)   possibility to use a new OpenGl pipeline and to define keystoning parameters (for projections)   faster java2D displays (esp. on zoom)   better user interaction (mouse move, hover, key listener)   a whole new set of charts   getting values when moving the mouse on charts   possibility to declare permanent layout:  + #splitted, #horizontal, #vertical, #stacked in the output section to automatically layout the display view.

Then we modify the aspect in order to display this geometry instead of the shape of the agent. In order to avoid  z-fighting  problems, we add a depth to the geometry (of 3 meters).  species road {  geometry display_shape <- shape + 2.0;  aspect geom {   draw display_shape color: #black depth: 3.0;  } }   global variable We define a new global variable called is_night of type bool to indicate if it is night or not.

This aspect draw people agent as a 3m sphere.

We change its name to map_3D to better reflect its visual aspect.  In order to get a 3D aspect, we specify that this display will be an opengl one. For that, we just have to add the facet type: opengl. In addition, to get a different light between night and day :  The statement light allows us to declare a light. We can change up to 7 lights, called through the facet  id . The default light is a white light, directional, with the id=1. You can set the intensity of the light through the facet  color  (you can pass a color, or an integer between 0 and 255). To have a nice effect night / day, we will set the intensity of the light to 50 during the night, and 255 for the day. To learn more about light, please read this page.  Then, we add a new layer that consists in an image (soil.jpg) by using the image statement. In order to see the people inside the building, we add transparency to the building (0.5). The transparency of a layer is a float value between 0 (solid) and 1 (totally transparent). In order to be able to manage this transparency aspect, opengl has to draw the people agents before the building, thus we modify the order of drawing of the different layers (people agents before building agents).

Formulation    Load, agentify and display two layers of GIS data (building and road)   Modify the initialization of the people agents to put them inside buildings     Model Definition  species We have to define two species of agents: the building agents and the road ones. These agents will not have a particular behavior, they will just be displayed. We define an aspect for these species. In this model, we want to represent the geometry of the agent, we then use the keyword draw that allow to draw a given geometry. In order to draw the geometry of the agent we use the attribute shape (which is a built-in attribute of all agents).      species building {  aspect geom {   draw shape color: #gray;  } }  species road {  aspect geom {   draw shape color: #black;  } }      parameters GAMA allows to automatically read GIS data that are formatted as shapefiles. In order to let the user chooses his/her shapefiles, we define two parameters. One allowing the user to choose the road shapefile, one allowing him/her to choose the building shapefile.  Definition of the two global variables of type file concerning the GIS files:  global {    file shape_file_buildings <- file(../includes/building.shp);    file shape_file_roads <- file(../includes/road.shp); }   agentification of GIS data  In GAMA, the agentification of GIS data is very straightforward: it only requires to use the create command with the from facet to pass the shapefile. Each object of the shapefile will be directly used to instantiate an agent of the specified species.  We modify the init section of the global block in order to create road and building agents from the shape files. Then, we define the initial location of people as a point inside one of the building.  global {   ... init {   create road from: roads_shapefile;   create building from: buildings_shapefile;   create people number:nb_people {    speed <- 5.0 #km/#h;    building bd <- one_of(building);    location <- any_location_in(bd);   }   ask nb_infected_init among people {    is_infected <- true;   }  } }   We defined here a local variable called bd of type building that is a one of the building (randomly chosen). Note that the name of a species can be used to obtain all the agents of this species (here building returns the list of all the buildings). The any_location_in returns a random point inside a geometry or an agent geometry.  environment Building a GIS environment in GAMA requires nothing special, just to define the bounds of the environment, i.e. the geometry of the world agent.

This reflex increments the staying_counter, then it test the probability to leave that is computed from the staying_counter (longer the agent is inside the building, more it has a chance to leave) and the staying_coeff (closer to 9h, 12h and 18h, more the agent has a chance to leave).

Simple SI Model","content":"1. Simple SI Model This first step Illustrates how to write a model in GAMA. In particular, it describes how to structure a model and how to define species - that are the key components of GAMA models.

Model Definition  model structure A GAMA model is composed of three type of sections:   * global : this section, that is unique, defines the  world  agent, a special agent of a GAMA model. It represents all that is global to the model: dynamics, variables, actions. In addition, it allows to initialize the simulation (init block).   * species : these sections define the species of agents composing the model.   * experiment : these sections define a context of execution of the simulations. In particular, it defines the input (parameters) and output (displays, files…) of a model.  More details about the different sections of a GAMA model can be found here.  species A species represents a «prototype» of agents: it defines their common properties.  A species includes several sub-definitions:   * the internal state of its agents (attributes)   * their behavior   * how they are displayed (aspects)  GAMA provides as well the possibility to give skills to species of agents. A skillI is a module integrating variables and actions coded in Java.  Concerning our model, we will give the moving skill to the people agents: it will give to the people agents supplementary variables (speed, heading, destination) and actions (follow, goto, move, wander).   species people skills:moving{ }   Concerning the internal state, a attribute is defined as follows: type of the attribute (int (integer), float (floating point number), string, bool (boolean, true or false), point (coordinates), list, pair, map, file, matrix, espèce d agents, rgb (color), graph, path…) + name   * Optional facets: <- (initial value), update (value recomputed at each step of the simulation), function:{..} (value computed each time the variable is used), min, max  Note that all the species inherit from predefined built-in variables:   * A name (name)   * A shape (shape)   * A location (location) : the centroid of its shape.  We will give a variable to people agents: is_infected (bool):  species people skills:moving{    bool is_infected <- false; }   Concerning the display of an agent, aspects have to be defined. An aspect represents a possible way to display the agents of a species : aspect aspect_name {…} In the block of an aspect, it is possible to draw :   * A geometry :  for instance, the shape of the agent   * An image : to draw icons   * A text : to draw a text  We define an aspect for this species. In this model, we want to display for each people agent a circle of radius 5 and red or green according to the value of is_infected (if infected: red, green otherwise). We then use the keyword draw with a circle shape. To define the color that depends on is_infected, we use the tertiary operator condition ? val1 : val2. If the condition is true, this operator will return val1, otherwise val2. Note that it is possible to get a color value by using the symbol # + color name: e.g. #blue, #red, #white, #yellow, #magenta, #pink…  species people skills:moving{    ...  aspect circle{   draw circle(5) color:is_infected ? #red : #green;  } }  Concerning the behavior of agents, the simplest way to define it is through reflexes. A reflex is a block of statements (that can be defined in global or any species) that will be automatically executed at each simulation step if its condition is true. A reflex is defined as follows:     reflex reflex_name when: condition {...}   The when facet is optional: when it is omitted, the reflex is activated at each time step. Note that if several reflexes are defined for a species, the reflexes will be activated following their definition order.  We define a first reflex called move that allows the people agents to move using the wander action (provided by the moving skill) that allows to randomly move (with taking into account the agent speed)  species people {  ...  reflex move{   do wander;  } }   Note that an action is a capability available to the agents of a species (what they can do). It is a block of statements that can be used and reused whenever needed. Some actions, called primitives, are directly coded in Java: for instance, the wander action defined in the moving skill.   * An action can accept arguments. For instance, write takes an argument called message.   * An action can return a result.  There are two ways to call an action: using a statement or as part of an expression   * for actions that do not return a result:  do action_name arg1: v1 arg2: v2;      for actions that return a result:  my_var <- self action_name (arg1:v1, arg2:v2);    The second reflex we have to define is the infect one. This reflex will be activated only if is_infected is true.

This statement allows to make a remote agent executes a list of statements. We used as well the flip operator that allows to test a probability.  global section The global section represents the definition of the species of a specific agent (called world). The world agent represents everything that is global to the model: dynamics, variables… It allows to init simulations (init block): the world is always created and initialized first when a simulation is launched. The geometry (shape) of the world agent is by default a square with 100m for side size, but can be redefined if necessary. In the same way, the modeler can redefined the step variable that represent the duration of a simulation step and that is by default 1 second.  global variable For our model, we define 4 global variables: nb_people (int, init value: 500), infection distance (float value, init value: 2 meters), proba_infection (float, init value: 0.05) and nb_infected_init (int, init value: 5). In addition, we redefine the geometry of the world by a square of 500 meters size and a simulation step of 1 minute.  global{   int nb_people <- 500;  float infection_distance <- 2.0 #m;  float proba_infection <- 0.05;  int nb_infected_init <- 5;  float step <- 1 #minutes;  geometry shape<-square(500 #m); }   Model initialization The init section of the global block allows to initialize the model. The statement create allows to create agents of a specific species: create species_name + :   * number : number of agents to create (int, 1 by default)   * from : GIS file to use to create the agents (string or file)   * returns: list of created agents (list)  For our model, definition of the init block in order to create nb_people people agents. We set the init value of the speed variable (given by the moving skill) to 5km/h. > In addition we ask nb_infected_init people to become infected (use of the nb among list to randomly draw nb elements of the list).  global{   ...  init{   create people number:nb_people {    speed <- 5.0 #km/#h;   }   ask nb_infected_init among people {    is_infected <- true;   }  } }   experiment An experiment block defines how a model can be simulated (executed). Several experiments can be defined for a model. They are defined using : experiment exp_name type: gui/batch {input output}   * gui : experiment with a graphical interface, which displays its input parameters and outputs.   * batch : Allows to setup a series of simulations (w/o graphical interface).  In our model, we define a gui experiment called main_experiment :  experiment main_experiment type: gui { }   input Experiments can define (input) parameters. A parameter definition allows to make the value of a global variable definable by the user through the graphic interface.  A parameter is defined as follows: parameter title var: global_var category: cat;   * title : string to display   * var : reference to a global variable (defined in the global section)   * category : string used to «store» the operators on the UI - optional   * <- : init value - optional   * min : min value - optional   * max : min value - optional  Note that the init, min and max values can be defined in the global variable definition.  In the experiment, definition of three parameters from the the global variable infection_distance, proba_infection and nb_infected_init :  experiment main_experiment type:gui{  parameter Infection distance var: infection_distance;  parameter Proba infection var: proba_infection min: 0.0 max: 1.0;  parameter Nb people infected at init var: nb_infected_init ;  ... }   output Output blocks are defined in an experiment and define how to visualize a simulation (with one or more display blocks that define separate windows). Each display can be refreshed independently by defining the facet refresh_every: nb (int) (the display will be refreshed every nb steps of the simulation).  Each display can include different layers (like in a GIS) :   * Agents lists : agents layer_name value: agents_list aspect: my_aspect;   * Agents species : species  my_species aspect: my_aspect   * Images: image layer_name file: image_file;   * Texts : texte layer_name value: my_text;   * Charts : see later.  Note that it is possible to define a opengl display (for 3D display) by using the facet type: opengl.  In our model, we define a display to draw the people agents with their circle aspect.  experiment main_experiment type:gui{  ...  output {   display map {    species people aspect:circle;      }  } }   Complete Model      model SI_city  global{   int nb_people <- 500;  float agent_speed <- 5.0 #km/#h;  float infection_distance <- 2.0 #m;  float proba_infection <- 0.05;  int nb_infected_init <- 5;  float step <- 1 #minutes;  geometry shape<-square(500 #m);  init{  create people number:nb_people;  ask nb_infected_init among people {   is_infected <- true;  } }   }  species people skills:moving{    float speed <- agent_speed;  bool is_infected <- false;  reflex move{   do wander;  }  reflex infect when: is_infected{   ask people at_distance infection_distance {    if flip(proba_infection) {     is_infected <- true;    }   }  }  aspect circle{   draw circle(5) color:is_infected ? #red : #green;  } }  experiment main_experiment type:gui{  parameter  Infection distance  var: infection_distance;  parameter  Proba infection  var: proba_infection min: 0.0 max: 1.0;  parameter  Nb people infected at init  var: nb_infected_init ;  output {   display map {    species people aspect:circle;      }  } }     ","url":"wiki/IncrementalModel_step1.md"},{"id":"wiki/IncrementalModel_step6.md","title":" 6. Multi-Level","content":"6. Multi-Level This step Illustrates how to define a multi-level model  Formulation We propose to let the buildings manage what happens when the people are inside buildings. In this context, we will use the multi-level properties of GAMA: when a people agent will be inside a building, it will be captured by it and its species will be modified. It will be not anymore the people agent that will decide when to leave the building, but the building itself.  We will need to:   * define a micro-species of people inside the building species (people_in_buildings)   * define a new variable for the building agent (people_inbuilding)   * define two new behaviors for building: let_people_leave and let_people_enter   * modify the aspect of the building   * modify some global variables for counting the number of infected people    Model Definition ### building First, we define a new species called people_in_building inside the building species. Thus, a building could have agents of this species as members and control them. The people_in_building species has for parent the people species, which means that a people_in_building agent has all the properties, aspect and behaviors of a people agent. In our case, we want the once a people agent inside a building, this people agent does nothing. Then, we use the schedules facet of the species to remove the people_in_building from the scheduler.   species building {  ...  species people_in_building parent: people schedules:  {  }  ... }   We define a new dynamic variable for building agent: people_inside that will correspond to the list of people_in_building agents inside the building. Note that we use the syntax -> {…} to make the variable dynamic. However, instead of update that allows a variable to be recomputed at each simulation step, the syntax -> {…} allows the variable to be recomputed each time it is called (and thus avoid outdated problems). To compute this variable, we use the members built-in variable that corresponds to the list of micro-agents captured by the macro-agent.   species building {  ...  list<people_in_building> people_inside -> {members collect people_in_building(each)};  ... }   We define a first reflex for the buildings that will be activated at each simulation step and that will allow the building to capture all the people that are inside its geometry and that are not moving (target = nil). Capturing agents means putting them inside its members list and changing their species: here the people agents become people_in_building agents.  species building {  ...       reflex let_people_enter {   list<people> entering_people <- people inside self where (each.target = nil);   if not (empty (entering_people)) {    capture entering_people as: people_in_building ;    }  }  .... }   We define a second reflex for the buildings that will be activated at each simulation step and that will allow the building to release some of the people_in_building agents. First, it increments the staying counter of all the people_in_building agents. Then it builds the list of leaving people by testing the same probability as before for all the people_in_building agents. Finally, if this list is not empty, it releases them as people agents (and gives them a new target point).   species building {  ... reflex let_people_leave  {   ask members as: people_in_building{    staying_counter <- staying_counter + 1;   }   list<people_in_building> leaving_people <- list<people_in_building>(members where (flip(people_in_building(each).staying_counter / staying_coeff)));   if not (empty (leaving_people)) {    release leaving_people as: people in: world returns: released_people;    ask released_people {     target <- any_location_in (one_of(building));    }   }  }  .... }   At last, we refine the aspect of the buildings: if there is not people inside the building, we draw it with gray color. If the number of people_in_building infected is higher than the number of people_in_building not infected, we draw it in red; otherwise in green.   species building {  ...  aspect geom {    int nbI <- members count people_in_building(each).is_infected;   int nbT <- length(members);   draw shape color:nbT = 0 ? #gray : (float(nbI)/nbT > 0.5 ? #red : #green) depth: height;  } }   global variables In order to take into account the people that are inside the buildings for the computation of nb_people_infected, we first build the list of people_in_building. As people_in_building is a macro species of building, we cannot compute it directly like for the other species, we then aggregate all the list people_inside of all building in a single list (list_people_in_buildings). Then, we compute the number of infected people as the number of people infected outside the building + the number of people infected inside them.   global  {  ...  list<people_in_building> list_people_in_buildings update: (building accumulate each.people_inside) where (not dead(each));  int nb_people_infected <- nb_infected_init update: people count (each.is_infected) + (empty(list_people_in_buildings) ? 0 : list_people_in_buildings count (each.is_infected));  ... }   Complete Model       global  {  int nb_people <- 500;  float step <- 1 #minutes;  float infection_distance <- 2.0 #m;  float proba_infection <- 0.05;  int nb_infected_init <- 5;  file roads_shapefile <- file( ../includes/road.shp );  file buildings_shapefile <- file( ../includes/building.shp );  geometry shape <- envelope(roads_shapefile);  graph road_network;  int current_hour update: (cycle / 60) mod 24;  float staying_coeff update: 10.0 ^ (1 + min(abs(current_hour - 9), abs(current_hour - 12), abs(current_hour - 18)));  list<people_in_building> list_people_in_buildings update: (building accumulate each.people_inside) where (not dead(each)); int nb_people_infected <- nb_infected_init update: people count (each.is_infected) + (empty(list_people_in_buildings) ? 0 : list_people_in_buildings count (each.is_infected));  int nb_people_not_infected <- nb_people - nb_infected_init update: nb_people - nb_people_infected; bool is_night <- true update: current_hour < 7 or current_hour > 20;  float infected_rate update: nb_people_infected/nb_people; init {  create road from: roads_shapefile;  road_network <- as_edge_graph(road);  create building from: buildings_shapefile;  create people number:nb_people {   speed <- 5.0 #km/#h;   building bd <- one_of(building);   location <- any_location_in(bd);  }  ask nb_infected_init among people {   is_infected <- true;  }   } reflex end_simulation when: infected_rate = 1.0 {    do halt; } }   species people skills:moving{    bool is_infected <- false;  point target;  int staying_counter;  reflex move when: target != nil{  do goto target:target on: road_network;  if (location = target) {   target <- any_location_in (one_of(building));   target <- nil;   staying_counter <- 0;  }  } reflex infect when: is_infected{  ask people at_distance infection_distance {   if flip(proba_infection) {    is_infected <- true;   }  } } aspect circle{  draw circle(5) color:is_infected ? #red : #green; } aspect sphere3D{  draw sphere(3) at: {location.x,location.y,location.z + 3} color:is_infected ? #red : #green; } }   species road {  geometry display_shape <- shape + 2.0;  aspect geom {   draw display_shape color: #black depth: 3.0;  } }  species building {  float height <- 10#m + rnd(10) #m;  list people_inside -> {members collect people_in_building(each)};  aspect geom {  int nbI <- members count people_in_building(each).is_infected;  int nbT <- length(members);  draw shape color:nbT = 0 ? #gray : (float(nbI)/nbT > 0.5 ? #red : #green) depth: height; }  species people_in_building parent: people schedules:  {  aspect circle{}  aspect sphere3D{} }  species people_in_2 parent: people schedules:  {  aspect circle{}  aspect sphere3D{} }  reflex let_people_leave  {  ask members as: people_in_building{   staying_counter <- staying_counter + 1;  }  list<people_in_building> leaving_people <- list<people_in_building>(members where (flip(people_in_building(each).staying_counter / staying_coeff)));  if not (empty (leaving_people)) {   release leaving_people as: people in: world returns: released_people;   ask released_people {    target <- any_location_in (one_of(building));   }  } } reflex let_people_enter {  list<people> entering_people <- people inside self where (each.target = nil);  if not (empty (entering_people)) {   capture entering_people as: people_in_building ;    } } }   experiment main_experiment type:gui{  parameter  Infection distance  var: infection_distance;  parameter  Proba infection  var: proba_infection min: 0.0 max: 1.0;  parameter  Nb people infected at init  var: nb_infected_init ;  output {   monitor  Current hour  value: current_hour;   monitor  Infected people rate  value: infected_rate;   display map_3D type: opengl {    light 1 color:(is_night ? 50 : 255);    image  ../includes/soil.jpg ;    species road aspect:geom;    species people aspect:sphere3D;       species building aspect:geom transparency: 0.5;   }   display chart refresh:every(10) {    chart  Disease spreading  type: series {     data  susceptible  value: nb_people_not_infected color: #green;     data  infected  value: nb_people_infected color: #red;    }   }  } }     ","url":"wiki/IncrementalModel_step6.md"},{"id":"wiki/IncrementalModel_step2.md","title":" 2.

Differential Equations","content":"7. Differential Equations This step Illustrates how to use differential equations  Formulation We are interested by the spreading of the disease inside the buildings. In order to model it, we will use differential equations. So, we will need to:     add two global variables to define the building epidemic properties (beta and h).   add new variables for the buildings (I, S, T, t, I_to_1);   define differential equations for disease spreading inside buildings   add a behavior for buildings for the spreading of the disease.     Model Definition ### global variables We define two new global variables that will be used disease spreading dynamic inside the buildings.  global  {  ...  float beta <- 0.01;  float h<-0.1;  ... }  ### building In order to define the disease spreading dynamic, we define several variables that will be used by the differential equations:   * I : float, number of people infected in the building   * S : float, number of people not infected in the building   * T : float, total number of people in the building   * t : float, current time     * I_to1 : float, remaining number of people infected (float number lower between 0 and 1 according to the differential equations).  species building {  ....  float I;  float S;  float T;     float t;        float I_to1;   ... }   Then, we define the differential equations that will use for the disease spreading dynamic. Note that to define a differential equation system we use the block equation + name. These equations are the classic ones used by SI mathematical models.  species building {  ....  equation SI{    diff(S,t) = (- beta * S * I / T) ;   diff(I,t) = (  beta * S * I / T) ;  } ... }   At last, we define a new reflex for the building called epidemic that will be activated only when there is someone inside the building. This reflex first compute the number of people inside the building (T), then the number of not infected people (S) and finally the number of infected ones (I).  If there is at least one people infected and one people not infected, the differential equations is integrated (according to the discretisation step value h) with the method Runge-Kutta 4 to compute the new value of infected people. We then sum the old value of I_to_1 with the number of people newly infected (this value is a float and not an integer). Finally, we cast this value as an integer, ask the corresponding number of not infected people to become infected, and decrement this integer value to I_to1.  species building {  ....  reflex epidemic when: not empty(members){     T <- float(length(members));   list<people_in_building> S_members <- list<people_in_building>(members where not (people_in_building(each).is_infected));       S <- float(length(S_members));       I <- T-S;       float I0 <- I;       if (I > 0 and S > 0) {              solve SI method: rk4 step: h;              I_to1 <- I_to1 + (I - I0);              int I_int <- min(int(S),int(I_to1));              I_to1 <- I_to1 - I_int;              ask(I_int among S_members){             is_infected <- true;             }      }      } ... }   Complete Model      model model7  global  {  int nb_people <- 500;  float step <- 1 #minutes;  float infection_distance <- 2.0 #m;  float proba_infection <- 0.05;  int nb_infected_init <- 5;  file roads_shapefile <- file( ../includes/road.shp );  file buildings_shapefile <- file( ../includes/building.shp );  geometry shape <- envelope(roads_shapefile);  graph road_network;  int current_hour update: (cycle / 60) mod 24;  float staying_coeff update: 10.0 ^ (1 + min(abs(current_hour - 9), abs(current_hour - 12), abs(current_hour - 18)));  float beta <- 0.01;  float h<-0.1;  list list_people_in_buildings update: (building accumulate each.people_inside) where (not dead(each));  int nb_people_infected <- nb_infected_init update: people count (each.is_infected) + (empty(list_people_in_buildings) ?

In the road network graph, more a road is worn out (destruction_coeff high), more a people agent takes time to go all over it.

Formulation    Definition of day_time global variable that will indicate, according to the simulation step, the time of the day: each simulation step will represent 10 minutes, then the day_time variable will be ranged between 0 and 144.   For each people agent: define a living_place(building of type  Residential ) and working place (building of type  Industrial ).   For each people agent: define start_work and end_work hours that respectively represent when the agent leaves its house to go to work and when it leaves its working_place to go back home. These hours will be randomly define between 36 (6 a.m;) and 60 (10 a.m.) for the start_work and 84 (2p.m.) and 132 (10p.m.) for the end_work.   For each people agent: define a objective variable: this one can  go home  or  working .   For each people agent: define a speed. The speed will be randomly define between 50 and 100.   The people agents move along the road, taking the shortest path.   Model Definition  people agents First, we have to change the skill of the people agents: as we want to use an action of the moving skill (goto), we will provide the people agents with this skill. A skill is a built-in module that provide the modeler a self-contain and relevant set of actions and variables.      species people skills: moving{ ...    }   Then, we have to add new variables to the people agents: living_place, working_place, start_work, end_work, objective. In addition, we will add a  the_target  variable that will represents the point toward which the agent will be currently moving.         species people skills: moving{  rgb color <- #yellow ;  building living_place <- nil ;  building working_place <- nil ;  int start_work ;  int end_work  ;  string objective ;   point the_target <- nil ;     ...    }       We define two reflex methods that allow to change the objective (and the_target) of the agent at the start_work and en_work hours. Concerning the target value, we choose a random point in the objective building (working_place or living_place) by using the any_location_in operator.         species people skills: moving{       …       reflex time_to_work when: current_hour = start_work and objective =  resting {  objective <-  working  ;     the_target <- any_location_in (working_place);       }    reflex time_to_go_home when: current_hour = end_work and objective = working{    objective <- resting ;    the_target <- any_location_in (living_place);    }    ...   }       At last, we define a reflex method that allows the agent to move. If a target point is defined (the_target != nil), the agent moves in direction to its target using the goto action (provided by the moving skill). Note that we specified a graph to constraint the movement of the agents on the road network with the facet on. We will see later how this graph is built. The agent uses the shortest path (according to the graph) to go to the target point. When the agent arrives at destination (the_target = location), the target is set to nil (the agent will stop moving).     species people skills: moving{       ...       reflex move when: the_target != nil {    do goto target: the_target on: the_graph ;     if the_target = location {   the_target <- nil ;    }      }   }   parameters We add several parameters (min_work_start, max_work_start, min_work_end, max_work_end, min_speed and max_speed) and two global variables: the_graph (graph computed from the road network) and current_hour (current hour of the day). The value of the current_hour variable is automatically computed at each simulation step and is equals to  (time(the simulation step step) / 1 hour) modulo 24 .  In the global section:  global {  ...  int current_hour update: (time / #hour) mod 24;  int min_work_start <- 6;  int max_work_start <- 8;  int min_work_end <- 16;   int max_work_end <- 20;   float min_speed <- 1.0 #km / #h;  float max_speed <- 5.0 #km / #h;   graph the_graph;  ... }   In the experiment section:  experiment road_traffic type: gui {  ...   parameter Earliest hour to start work var: min_work_start category: People min: 2 max: 8;  parameter Latest hour to start work var: max_work_start category: People min: 8 max: 12;  parameter Earliest hour to end work var: min_work_end category: People min: 12 max: 16;  parameter Latest hour to end work var: max_work_end category: People min: 16 max: 23;  parameter minimal speed var: min_speed category: People min: 0.1 #km/#h ;  parameter maximal speed var: max_speed category: People max: 10 #km/#h;  ... }  ### initialization First, we need to compute from the road agents, a graph for the moving of the people agents. The operator as_edge_graph allows to do that. It automatically builds from a set of agents or geometries a graph where the agents are the edges of the graph, a node represent the extremities of the agent geometry.     init {       ...       create road from: shape_file_roads ;       the_graph <- as_edge_graph(road);       ...    }   We randomly assign one working place and one house to each people agent. To simplify the GAML code, we define two temporary variables: the list of buildings of type  Residential  and the list of buildings of type  Industrial  (by using the where command). At the creation of each people agent, we define a speed, a start_work and end_work to each people agent (according to the min and max define in the parameters). We define as well an initial objective ( resting ). Concerning the definition of the living_place and working_place, these ones are randomly chosen in the residential_buildings and industrial_buildings lists.     init {       ...       list<building> residential_buildings <- building where (each.type=Residential);       list<building>  industrial_buildings <- building  where (each.type=Industrial) ;       create people number: nb_people { speed <- min_speed + rnd (max_speed - min_speed) ; start_work <- min_work_start + rnd (max_work_start - min_work_start) ; end_work <- min_work_end + rnd (max_work_end - min_work_end) ; living_place <- one_of(residential_buildings) ; working_place <- one_of(industrial_buildings) ; objective <- resting; location <- any_location_in (living_place); }       ...   }   Complete Model      model tutorial_gis_city_traffic  global {  file shape_file_buildings <- file( ../includes/building.shp );  file shape_file_roads <- file( ../includes/road.shp );  file shape_file_bounds <- file( ../includes/bounds.shp );  geometry shape <- envelope(shape_file_bounds);  float step <- 10 #mn;  int nb_people <- 100;  int current_hour update: (time / #hour) mod 24;  int min_work_start <- 6;  int max_work_start <- 8;  int min_work_end <- 16;   int max_work_end <- 20;   float min_speed <- 1.0 #km / #h;  float max_speed <- 5.0 #km / #h;   graph the_graph;  init {  create building from: shape_file_buildings with: type::string(read (NATURE)) {   if type=Industrial {    color <- #blue ;   }  }  create road from: shape_file_roads ;  the_graph <- as_edge_graph(road);    list<building> residential_buildings <- building where (each.type=Residential);  list<building>  industrial_buildings <- building  where (each.type=Industrial) ;  create people number: nb_people {   speed <- min_speed + rnd (max_speed - min_speed) ;   start_work <- min_work_start + rnd (max_work_start - min_work_start) ;   end_work <- min_work_end + rnd (max_work_end - min_work_end) ;   living_place <- one_of(residential_buildings) ;   working_place <- one_of(industrial_buildings) ;   objective <- resting;   location <- any_location_in (living_place);   } } }   species building {  string type;   rgb color <- #gray  ;  aspect base {  draw shape color: color ; } }   species road  {  rgb color <- #black ;  aspect base {   draw shape color: color ;  } }  species people skills:moving {  rgb color <- #yellow ;  building living_place <- nil ;  building working_place <- nil ;  int start_work ;  int end_work  ;  string objective ;   point the_target <- nil ;  reflex time_to_work when: current_hour = start_work and objective = resting{  objective <- working ;  the_target <- any_location_in (working_place); }   reflex time_to_go_home when: current_hour = end_work and objective = working{  objective <- resting ;  the_target <- any_location_in (living_place);  }    reflex move when: the_target != nil {  do goto target: the_target on: the_graph ;   if the_target = location {   the_target <- nil ;  } }  aspect base {  draw circle(10) color: color; } }   experiment road_traffic type: gui {  parameter  Shapefile for the buildings:  var: shape_file_buildings category:  GIS  ;  parameter  Shapefile for the roads:  var: shape_file_roads category:  GIS  ;  parameter  Shapefile for the bounds:  var: shape_file_bounds category:  GIS  ;  parameter  Number of people agents  var: nb_people category:  People  ;  parameter  Earliest hour to start work  var: min_work_start category:  People  min: 2 max: 8;  parameter  Latest hour to start work  var: max_work_start category:  People  min: 8 max: 12;  parameter  Earliest hour to end work  var: min_work_end category:  People  min: 12 max: 16;  parameter  Latest hour to end work  var: max_work_end category:  People  min: 16 max: 23;  parameter  minimal speed  var: min_speed category:  People  min: 0.1 #km/#h ;  parameter  maximal speed  var: max_speed category:  People  max: 10 #km/#h;  output {  display city_display type:opengl {   species building aspect: base ;   species road aspect: base ;   species people aspect: base ;  } } }      ","url":"wiki/RoadTrafficModel_step3.md"},{"id":"wiki/RoadTrafficModel_step2.md","title":" 2.

To filter the list of building agents (obtained by building), we use the where operator. We use the operator one_of to randomly select one agent of this list. There are several ways to place a people agent inside this building. In this tutorial, we choose to use the any_location_in operator.

Loading of GIS Data","content":"1. Loading of GIS Data This first step Illustrates how to load GIS data (shapefiles) and to read attributes from GIS data.  Formulation    Set the time duration of a time step to 10 minutes   Load, agentify and display two layers of GIS data (building and road). Agentifying a GIS element will allow us to give it a behavior later on (thus not being simply a static/passive object).   Read the  NATURE  attribute of the building data: the buildings of  Residential  type will be colored in gray, the buildings of  Industrial  type will be color in blue.   Model Definition  species In this first model, we have to define two species of agents: the building agents and the road ones. These agents will not have a particular behavior, they will just be displayed. For each of these species, we define a new attribute: color of type rgb, with for initial value:  black  for the road agent and  gray  (by default) for the building agent. Concerning the building agent, we define a second attribute named type representing the type of the building ( Residential  or  Industrial ). At last, we define an aspect for these species. In this model, we want to represent the geometry of the agent, we then use the keyword draw that allow to draw a given geometry. In order to draw the geometry of the agent we use the attribute shape (which is a built-in attribute of all agents).      species building {  string type;   rgb color <- #gray  ;  aspect base {  draw shape color: color ; } }   species road  {  rgb color <- #black ;      aspect base {  draw shape color: color ; } }       parameters GAMA allows to automatically read GIS data that are formatted as shapefiles. In order to let the user chooses his/her shapefiles, we define three parameters. One allowing the user to choose the road shapefile, one allowing him/her to choose the building shapefile, and, at last, one allowing him/her to choose the bounds shapefile. We will come back later on the notion of  bounds  in GAMA.  Definition of the three global variables of type file concerning the GIS files:  global {    file shape_file_buildings <- file(../includes/building.shp);    file shape_file_roads <- file(../includes/road.shp);    file shape_file_bounds <- file(../includes/bounds.shp); }   In the experiment section, we add three parameters to allow the user to change the shapefile used directly through the UI:  experiment road_traffic type: gui {    parameter Shapefile for the buildings: var: shape_file_buildings category: GIS ;    parameter Shapefile for the roads: var: shape_file_roads category: GIS ;    parameter Shapefile for the bounds: var: shape_file_bounds category: GIS ; }   agentification of GIS data  In GAMA, the agentification of GIS data is very straightforward: it only requires to use the create command with the from facet to pass the shapefile. Each object of the shapefile will be directly used to instantiate an agent of the specified species. The reading of an attribute in a shapefile is also very simple. It only requires to use the with facet: the argument of this facet is a dictionary of which the keys are the names of the agent attributes and the value the read command followed by the name of the shapefile attribute ( NATURE  in our case).  Init section of the global block: creation of the road and building agents from the shape files. Concerning the building agents, reading of the  NATURE  attribute of the shapefile to initiate the value of the type attribute. If the type attribute is equal to  Industrial  set the color attribute to  blue .  global {   ...   init {    create building from: shape_file_buildings with: type::read (NATURE) {       if type=Industrial {   color <- #blue ;       }    }    create road from: shape_file_roads ;   }    time step In GAMA, by default, a time step represents 1 second. It is possible to redefine this value by overriding the step global variable. This value of the time step is used by the moving primitives of GAMA.  In our model, we define that a step represent 10 minutes. Note that it is possible to define the unit of a value by using # + unit name. For instance, #mn or #km for kilometers.   global {   ...   float step <- 10 #mn;   ... }  ### environment Building a GIS environment in GAMA requires nothing special, just to define the bounds of the environment, i.e. the geometry of the world agent. It is possible to use a shapefile to automatically define it by computing its envelope. In this model, we use a specific shapefile to define it. However, it would been possible to use the road shapefile to define it and let GAMA computes it enveloppe automatically.   global {   ...   geometry shape <- envelope(shape_file_bounds);    ... }   display We define a display to visualize the road and building agents. We use for that the classic species keyword. In order to optimize the display we use an opengl display (facet type: opengl).

For people that do not want to re-write all the models but just to follow the model construction, they can just download the model project here and the follow this procedure to import it into GAMA. For the other, the project and model creation procedures are detailed here.  Note that the concepts of workspace and projects are explained here.  model structure A GAMA model is composed of three type of sections:   * global : this section, that is unique, defines the  world  agent, a special agent of a GAMA model. It represents all that is global to the model: dynamics, variables, actions. In addition, it allows to initialize the simulation (init block).   * species and grid: these sections define the species of agents composing the model. Grid are defined in the following model step  vegetation dynamic ;   * experiment : these sections define a context of execution of the simulations. In particular, it defines the input (parameters) and output (displays, files…) of a model.  More details about the different sections of a GAMA model can be found here.  species A species represents a «prototype» of agents: it defines their common properties.  Three different elements can be defined in a species:   * the internal state of its agents (attributes)   * their behavior   * how they are displayed (aspects)  In our model, we define a people species:     species people {  }      In addition, we want add a new capability to our agent: the possibility to move randomly. for that, we add a specific skill to our people agents. A skill is a built-in module that provide the modeler a self-contain and relevant set of actions and variables. The moving provides the agents with several attributes and actions related to movement.      species people skills: moving{ ...    }   Internal state An attribute is defined as follows: type of the attribute  and name. Numerous types of attributes are available: int (integer), float (floating point number), string, bool (boolean, true or false), point (coordinates), list, pair, map, file, matrix, espèce d agents, rgb (color), graph, path…   * Optional facets: <- (initial value), update (value recomputed at each step of the simulation), function:{..} (value computed each time the variable is used), min, max  In addition to the attributes the modeler explicitly defines, species  inherits  other attributes called  built-in  variables:   * A name (name): the identifier of the species   * A shape (shape): the default shape of the agents to be construct after the species. It can be a point, a polygon, etc.   * A location (location) : the centroid of its shape.  In our model, we define 2 new attribute to our people agents:    * speed of type float, with for initial value: a random value between 2 and 5 km/h   * is_infected of type bool, with for initial value: false   species people skills:moving{    float speed <- (2 + rnd(3)) #km/#h;  bool is_infected <- false; }  Note we use the rnd operator to define a random value between 2 and 5 for the speed. In addition, we precise a unit for the speed value by using the # symbol. For more details about units, see here.  Behavior GAMA proposes several ways to define the behavior of a species: dynamic variables (update facet), reflexes….  A reflex is a block of statements (that can be defined in global or any species) that will be automatically executed at each simulation step if its condition is true, it is defined as follows:     reflex reflex_name when: condition {...}   The when facet is optional: when it is omitted, the reflex is activated at each time step. Note that if several reflexes are defined for a species, the reflexes will be activated following their definition order.  We define a first reflex called move that is activated at each simulation step (no condition) and that makes the people move randomly using the wander action from the moving skill.  species people skills:moving{    //variable definition  reflex move{   do wander;  } }   We define a second reflex called infect that is activated only when the agent is infected (is_infected = true) and that ask all the people at a distance of 10m to test a probability to be infected.     species people skills:moving{    //variable definition and move reflex  reflex infect when: is_infected{  ask people at_distance 10 #m {   if flip(0.05) {    is_infected <- true;   }  } } }     The ask(Statements#ask) allows an agent to ask another agents to do something (i.e. to execute a sequence of statements). The at_distance(Operators#at_distance) operator allows to get the list of agents (here of people agents) that are located at a distance lower or equal to the given distance (here 10m). The flip(Operators#flip) operator allows to test a probability.   Display An agent aspects have to be defined. An aspect is a way to display the agents of a species : aspect aspect_name {…} In the block of an aspect, it is possible to draw :   * A geometry :  for instance, the shape of the agent (but it may be a different one, for instance a disk instead of a complex polygon)   * An image : to draw icons   * A text : to draw a text  In our model, we define an aspect for the people agent called circle that draw the agents as a circle of 10m radius with a color that depends on their is_infected attribute. If the people agent is infected, it will be draw in red, in green otherwise.      species people {  …//variable and reflex definition  aspect circle {   draw circle(10) color:is_infected ? #red : #green;  } }  }     The **?** structure allows to return a different value (here red or green) according to a condition (here is_infected = true).   global section The global section represents a specific agent, called world. Defining this agent follows the same principle as any agent and is, thus, defined after a species. The world agent represents everything that is global to the model : dynamics, variables… It allows to initialize simulations (init block): the world is always created and initialized first when a simulation is launched (before any other agents). The geometry (shape) of the world agent is by default a square with 100m for side size, but can be redefined if necessary. The step attribute of the world agent allows to specify the duration of one simulation step (by default, 1 step = 1 seconde).  global variable In the current model, we define 4 global attributes:    * nb_people: the number of people that we want to create (init value: 2147)    * nb_infected_init: the number of people infected at the initialization of the simulation (init value: 5)    * step: redefine in order to set the duration of a simulation step to 5 minutes.    * shape: redefine in order to set the geometry of the world to a square of 1500 meters side size.   global {  int nb_people <- 2147;  int nb_infected_init <- 5;  float step <- 5 #mn;  geometry shape<-square(1500 #m); }   Model initialization  The init section of the global block allows to initialize the define what will happen at the initialization of a simulation, for instance to create agents. We use the statement create  to create agents of a specific species: create species_name + :   * number : number of agents to create (int, 1 by default)   * from : GIS file to use to create the agents (optional, string or file)   * returns: list of created agents (list)  For our model, we define the init block in order to create nb_people people agents and ask nb_infected_init of them to be infected:  global {  // world variable definition  init{   create people number:nb_people;   ask nb_infected_init among people {    is_infected <- true;   }  } }   experiment An experiment block defines how a model can be simulated (executed). Several experiments can be defined for a given model. They are defined using : experiment exp_name type: gui/batch {input output}   * gui : experiment with a graphical interface, which displays its input parameters and outputs.   * batch : Allows to setup a series of simulations (w/o graphical interface).  In our model, we define a gui experiment called main_experiment  :  experiment main_experiment type: gui { }   input Experiments can define (input) parameters. A parameter definition allows to make the value of a global variable definable by the user through the graphic interface.  A parameter is defined as follows: parameter title var: global_var category: cat;   * title : string to display   * var : reference to a global variable (defined in the global section)   * category : string used to «store» the operators on the UI - optional   * <- : init value - optional   * min : min value - optional   * max : min value - optional  Note that the init, min and max values can be defined in the global variable definition.  In our model, we define one parameter:    *  Nb people infected at init  that will define the value of the global variable nb_infected_init with a min value of 1 and a max value of 2147 (the number of people living in Luneray).      experiment main_experiment type:gui{  parameter  Nb people infected at init  var: nb_infected_init min: 1 max: 2147;  output { } }     #### output Output(DefiningGUIExperiment) blocks are defined in an experiment and define how to visualize a simulation (with one or more display(DefiningDisplaysGeneralities) blocks that define separate windows). Each display can be refreshed independently by defining the facet **refresh\\_every:** nb (int) (the display will be refreshed every nb steps of the simulation).   Each display can include different layers (like in a GIS) :   * Agents lists : agents layer_name value: agents_list aspect: my_aspect;   * Agents species : species  my_species aspect: my_aspect   * Images: image layer_name file: image_file;   * Texts : texte layer_name value: my_text;   * Charts : see later.

The shapefiles (and all the other files) can be found here.  species In this model, we have to define two species of agents: the road agents and the building ones. These agents will not have a particular behavior, they will just be displayed. For each of this species we define an aspect called geom. As we want to represent the geometry of the agent, we then use the keyword draw that allow to draw a given geometry. In order to draw the geometry of the agent we use the attribute shape (which is a built-in attribute of all agents). The road will be displayed in black and the building in gray.      species road {  aspect geom {   draw shape color: #black;  } }  species building {  aspect geom {   draw shape color: #gray;  } }       global section  global variables  GAMA allows to automatically read GIS data that are formatted as shape files (or as OSM file). In our model, we define 2 shapefiles: one corresponding to the roads and the other ones to the buildings. Note that GAMA is able to manage the projection of the GIS data.  In order to set the right size (and position) of the world geometry, we define its value as the envelope of the road shapefile (and no more a square of 1500 meters).      global{  //… other attributes  file roads_shapefile <- file( ../includes/routes.shp );  file buildings_shapefile <- file( ../includes/batiments.shp );  geometry shape <- envelope(roads_shapefile);   //… init }       agentification of GIS data  In GAMA, the agentification of GIS data is very straightforward: it only requires to use the create command with the from facet to pass the shapefile. Each object of the shapefile will be directly used to instantiate an agent of the specified species. The reading of an attribute in a shapefile is also very simple. It only requires to use the with facet: the argument of this facet is a dictionary of which the keys are the names of the agent attributes and the value the read command followed by the name of the shapefile attribute.  In our model, we modify the init section in order to first create the road agents from the road shapefile, and the building agents from the building shapefile.

Definition of monitors and chart outputs This second step illustrates how to create monitors and charts to follows the evolution of variables and to add an ending condition to the simulation.    Formulation    Add three new global dynamic variables to follow the evolution of the number of infected people agents, of not infected people agents and of the rate of infected people.

When an agent is activated, first, it recomputes each of its variables with a update facet (in their definition order), then it activates each of its reflexes (in their definition order).  To better follow the evolution of sick people, we add three new global variables to the model:   * nb_people_infected of type int with nb_infected_init as init value and updated at each simulation step by the number of infected people   * nb_people_not_infected of type int with (nb_people - nb_infected_init) as init value and updated at each simulation step by the number of not infected people   * infected_rate of type float updated at each simulation step by the number of infected people divided by the number of people.   global{  //... other attributes  int nb_people_infected <- nb_infected_init update: people count (each.is_infected);  int nb_people_not_infected <- nb_people - nb_infected_init update: nb_people - nb_people_infected;  float infected_rate update: nb_people_infected/nb_people;  //... init }   We used the count operator that allows to count the number of elements of a list for which the left condition is true. The keyword each represents each element of the list.  ending condition  The simplest way to add an ending condition to a model is to add a global reflex that is activated at the end of the simulation that will pause the simulation (use of the pause global action).  In our model, we add a new reflex called end_simulation that will be activated when the infected rate is 1.0 (i.e. all the people agents are infected) and that will apply the pause action.      global {  //.. variable and init definition  reflex end_simulation when: infected_rate = 1.0 {  do pause; } }      ### experiment   monitor GAMA provides modelers with the possibility to define monitors. A monitor allows to follow the value of an arbitrary expression in GAML. It will appear, in the User Interface, in a small window on its own and be recomputed every time step (or according to its  refresh  facet).  Definition of a monitor:    * value: mandatory, the expression whose value will be displayed by the monitor.    * refresh: bool, optional : if the expression is true, compute (default is true).  For our model, we define a monitor to follow the value of the infected_rate variable:     experiment main_experiment type:gui{  //…parameters  output {   monitor  Infected people rate  value: infected_rate;   //...display } }       Chart  In GAMA, charts are considered as a display layer.  GAMA can display 3 main types of charts using the type facet:     histogram   pie   series/xy/scatter: both display series with lines or dots, with 3 subtypes :  series: to display the evolution of one/several variable (vs time or not).       xy: to specify both x and y value.

Model Definition  global section  global variables  In this model, we want that people agents move from buildings to buildings by using the shortest path in the road network. In order to compute this shortest path, we need to use a graph structure.  We thus define a new global variable called road_network of type graph that will represent the road network.      global{  //… other attributes  graph road_network;  //... init }       In order to compute the graph from the road network, we use, just after having creating the road agents, the as_edge_graph operator. This operator automatically built a graph from a set of polylines. Each extremity point of the lines will become a node in the graph, and each polyline an edge. By default, the graph is not oriented and the weights of the edges are the perimeters of the polylines.

If the agent has to go, it will randomly choose a new target (a random location inside one of the building).   reflex stay when: target = nil {  if flip(0.05) {   target <- any_location_in (one_of(building));  } }   Then, we modify the move reflex. This one will be only activated when the agent will have to move (target not null). Instead of using the wander action of the moving skill, we use the goto one that allows to make an agent moves toward a given target. In addition, it is possible to add a facet on to precise on which topology the agent will have to move on. In our case, the topology is the road network. When the agent reach its destination (location = target), it sets its target to null.   reflex move when: target != nil{  do goto target:target on: road_network;  if (location = target) {   target <- nil;  }  }  ## Complete Model      model model4  global {  int nb_people <- 2147;  int nb_infected_init <- 5;  float step <- 5 #mn;  file roads_shapefile <- file( ../includes/roads.shp );  file buildings_shapefile <- file( ../includes/buildings.shp );  geometry shape <- envelope(roads_shapefile);   graph road_network;  int nb_people_infected <- nb_infected_init update: people count (each.is_infected); int nb_people_not_infected <- nb_people - nb_infected_init update: nb_people - nb_people_infected; float infected_rate update: nb_people_infected/nb_people;   init{  create road from: roads_shapefile;  road_network <- as_edge_graph(road);    create building from: buildings_shapefile;  create people number:nb_people {   location <- any_location_in(one_of(building));      }  ask nb_infected_init among people {   is_infected <- true;  } } }   species people skills:moving{    float speed <- (2 + rnd(3)) #km/#h;  bool is_infected <- false;  point target;  reflex stay when: target = nil {  if flip(0.05) {   target <- any_location_in (one_of(building));  } }   reflex move when: target != nil{  do goto target:target on: road_network;  if (location = target) {   target <- nil;  }  }  reflex infect when: is_infected{  ask people at_distance 10 #m {   if flip(0.05) {    is_infected <- true;   }  } }  aspect circle {  draw circle(10) color:is_infected ? #red : #green; } }   species road {  aspect geom {   draw shape color: #black;  } }  species building {  aspect geom {   draw shape color: #gray;  } }  experiment main type: gui {  parameter  Nb people infected at init  var: nb_infected_init min: 1 max: 2147;  output {  monitor Infected people rate value: infected_rate;    display map {   species road aspect:geom;   species building aspect:geom;   species people aspect:circle;     }    display chart_display refresh: every(10 #cycle) {   chart Disease spreading type: series {    data susceptible value: nb_people_not_infected color: #green;    data infected value: nb_people_infected color: #red;   }  } } }       Next step: Definition of 3D displays ","url":"wiki/LuneraysFlu_step4.md"},{"id":"wiki/LuneraysFlu_step5.md","title":" 5.

In this aspect, we use an obj file that contains a 3D object. The use of the obj_file operator allows to apply an initial rotation to an obj file. In our case, we add a rotation of -90° along the x axis. We specify with the size facet that we want to draw the 3D object inside a bounding box of 5m. As the location of the 3D object is its centroid and as we want to draw the 3D object on the top of the ground, we use the at facet to put an offset along the z axis. We use also the rotate facet to change the orientation of the 3D object according to the heading of the agent.

Practically, we will define monitors to follow the evolution of specific variables (or expression) whereas inspector allows to follow the state of a given agent (or a species).  Formulation    Adding of a monitor to follow the evolution of the number of prey agents   Model Definition  global variable We add a new global variable:   * nb_preys : returns, each time it is called, the current number of (live) prey agents  To do so we use the ->{expression} facet which returns the value of expression, each time it is called.. We use as well the operator length that returns the number of elements in a list.  Thus, In the global section, we add the nb_preys global variable:     int nb_preys -> {length (prey)};   monitor A monitor allows to follow the value of an arbitrary expression in GAML. It has to be defined in an output section. A monitor is defined as follows: monitor monitor_name value: an_expression refresh:every(nb_steps);   With:   * value: mandatory, its that value will be displayed in the monitor.   * refresh: bool, optional : if the expression is true, compute (default is true).  In this model, we define a monitor to follow the value of the variable nb_preys: monitor number of preys value: nb_preys;   inspector  Inspectors allow to obtain informations about a species or an agent. There are two kinds of agent information features:   * Species browser: provides informations about all the agents of a species. Available in the Agents menu.       Agent inspector: provides information about one specific agent. Also allows to change the values of its variables during the simulation. Available from the Agents menu, by right_clicking on a display, in the species inspector or when inspecting another agent. It provides also the possibility to «highlight» the inspected agent.

Writing Files","content":"11. Writing Files This 11th step Illustrates how to save data in a text file.  Formulation    At each simulation step, write in a text file:  The time step       The number of prey and predator agents       The min and max energy of the prey and predator agents Model Definition  global section GAMA provides several ways to write file.  A first ways consist in using the statement file in the output section: at each simulation step, the expression given is written in the given file.     file file_name type: file_type data: data_to_write;     With:   * file_name: string (by default the file in saved in the /models/ of your project directory)   * file_type: string  There are 2 possible types :   *  txt  (text) : in that case, my_data is treated as a string, which is written directly in the file   *  csv  : in that case, my_data is treated as a list of variables to write :  var1 ,  var2 ,  var3 .  A second way to write file consists in using the save statement:     save my_data type: file_type to: file_name;    With:   * file_type : string   * file_name : string  There are 3 possible types :   *  shp  (shapefile - GIS data) : in that case, my_data is treated as a list of agents : all their geometries are saved in the file (with some variables as attributes)   *  txt  (text) : in that case, my_data is treated as a string, which is written directly in the file   *  csv  : in that case, my_data is treated as a list of values : val1, val2, val3.  We use this statement (in a global reflex called save_result) to write:   * The cycle step: use of the cycle keyword that returns the current simulation step.   * The number of prey and predator agents: use of nb_preys and nb_predators variables   * The min and max energy of the prey and predator agents: use of list min_of expression and list max_of expression keywords.

Basic Model","content":"1. Basic Model This first step Illustrates how to write a model in GAMA. In particular, it describes how to structure a model and how to define species - that are the key components of GAMA models. ## Content  Formulation    Definition of the prey species   Definition of a nb_prey_init parameter   Creation of nb_prey_init prey agents randomly located in the environment (size: 100x100)   Model Definition  model structure A GAMA model is composed of three type of sections:   * global : this section, that is unique, defines the  world  agent, a special agent of a GAMA model. It represents all that is global to the model: dynamics, variables, actions. In addition, it allows to initialize the simulation (init block).   * species and grid: these sections define the species of agents composing the model. Grid are defined in the following model step  vegetation dynamic ;   * experiment : these sections define a context of execution of the simulations. In particular, it defines the input (parameters) and output (displays, files…) of a model.  More details about the different sections of a GAMA model can be found here.  species A species represents a «prototype» of agents: it defines their common properties.  A species definition requires the definition of three different elements :   * the internal state of its agents (attributes)   * their behavior   * how they are displayed (aspects)  Internal state An attribute is defined as follows: type of the attribute  and name. Numerous types of attributes are available: int (integer), float (floating point number), string, bool (boolean, true or false), point (coordinates), list, pair, map, file, matrix, espèce d agents, rgb (color), graph, path…   * Optional facets: <- (initial value), update (value recomputed at each step of the simulation), function:{..} (value computed each time the variable is used), min, max  In addition to the attributes the modeler explicitly defines, species  inherits  other attributes called  built-in  variables:   * A name (name): the identifier of the species   * A shape (shape): the default shape of the agents to be construct after the species. It can be a point, a polygon, etc.   * A location (location) : the centroid of its shape.  Behavior In this first model, we define one species of agents: the prey agents. For the moment, these agents will not have a particular behavior, they will just exist and be displayed.  Display An agent aspects have to be defined. An aspect is a way to display the agents of a species : aspect aspect_name {…} In the block of an aspect, it is possible to draw :   * A geometry :  for instance, the shape of the agent (but it may be a different one, for instance a disk instead of a complex polygon)   * An image : to draw icons   * A text : to draw a text  In order to display our prey agents we define two attributes:   * size of type float, with for initial value: 1.0   * color of type rgb, with for initial value:  blue . It is possible to get a color value by using the symbol # + color name: e.g. #blue, #red, #white, #yellow, #magenta, #pink…  Prey species code For the moment, we only define an aspect for this species. We want to display for each prey agent a circle of radius size and color color. We then use the keyword draw with a circle shape.      species prey {  float size <- 1.0 ;  rgb color <- #blue;  aspect base {  draw circle(size) color: color ; } }        global section The global section represents a specific agent, called world. Defining this agent follows the same principle as any agent and is, thus, defined after a species. The world agent represents everything that is global to the model : dynamics, variables… It allows to initialize simulations (init block): the world is always created and initialized first when a simulation is launched (before any other agents). The geometry (shape) of the world agent is by default a square with 100m for side size, but can be redefined if necessary (see the Road traffic tutorial).  global variable In the current model, we will only have a certain numbers of preys thus we need to hold this number in a global or world s variable of type integer (int) which can be done as follows:  global {    int nb_preys_init <- 200; }   Model initialization  The init section of the global block allows to initialize the model which is executing certain commands, here we will create nb_preys_init number of prey agents. We use the statement create  to create agents of a specific species: create species_name + :   * number : number of agents to create (int, 1 by default)   * from : GIS file to use to create the agents (optional, string or file)   * returns: list of created agents (list)  Definition of the init block in order to create nb_preys_init prey agents:     init {       create prey number: nb_preys_init ;    }   experiment An experiment block defines how a model can be simulated (executed). Several experiments can be defined for a given model. They are defined using : experiment exp_name type: gui/batch {input output}   * gui : experiment with a graphical interface, which displays its input parameters and outputs.   * batch : Allows to setup a series of simulations (w/o graphical interface).  In our model, we define a gui experiment called prey_predator  :  experiment prey_predator type: gui { }   input Experiments can define (input) parameters. A parameter definition allows to make the value of a global variable definable by the user through the graphic interface.  A parameter is defined as follows: parameter title var: global_var category: cat;   * title : string to display   * var : reference to a global variable (defined in the global section)   * category : string used to «store» the operators on the UI - optional   * <- : init value - optional   * min : min value - optional   * max : min value - optional  Note that the init, min and max values can be defined in the global variable definition.  In the experiment, definition of a parameter from the the global variable nb_preys_init :  experiment prey_predator type: gui {    parameter Initial number of preys:  var: nb_preys_init min: 1 max: 1000 category: Prey ; }   output Output blocks are defined in an experiment and define how to visualize a simulation (with one or more display blocks that define separate windows). Each display can be refreshed independently by defining the facet refresh_every: nb (int) (the display will be refreshed every nb steps of the simulation).  Each display can include different layers (like in a GIS) :   * Agents lists : agents layer_name value: agents_list aspect: my_aspect;   * Agents species : species  my_species aspect: my_aspect   * Images: image layer_name file: image_file;   * Texts : texte layer_name value: my_text;   * Charts : see later.  Note that it is possible to define a opengl display (for 3D display) by using the facet type: opengl.  In our model, we define a display to draw the prey agents.   output {       display main_display {   species prey aspect: base ;       }    }   Complete Model      model prey_predator  global {  int nb_preys_init <- 200;  init {   create prey number: nb_preys_init ;  } }  species prey {  float size <- 1.0 ;  rgb color <- #blue;  aspect base {  draw circle(size) color: color ; } }    experiment prey_predator type: gui {  parameter  Initial number of preys:   var: nb_preys_init min: 1 max: 1000 category:  Prey  ;  output {   display main_display {    species prey aspect: base ;   }  } }     ","url":"wiki/PredatorPrey_step1.md"},{"id":"wiki/PredatorPrey_step3.md","title":" 3. Prey Agent Behavior","content":"3. Prey Agent Behavior This third step Illustrates how to define the behaviors of prey agents and the concept of spatial topology.  Formulation    Random movement of the prey agents to a distance of 2 cells (Von Neumann neighborhood)   At each step, the prey agents loss energy   At each step, the prey agents eat food if there is food on the cell on which they are localized (with a max of max_transfer) and gain energy   If a prey agent has no more energy, it dies   Model Definition  parameters To define a behavior for the prey agents we add them three new parameters:   * The max energy of the prey agents   * The maximum energy that can a prey agent consume from vegetation per tick   * The energy used by a prey agent at each time step  As we consider these parameters to be global to all prey, we define them in the  global section as follows:         float prey_max_energy <- 1.0;    float prey_max_transfer <- 0.1;    float prey_energy_consum <- 0.05;       Yet we may allow the user to change it from an experiment to another through the user interface. To do so we add the following definition of parameters within the experiment section :     parameter Prey max energy:  var: prey_max_energy category: Prey ;    parameter Prey max transfer:  var: prey_max_transfer  category: Prey ;    parameter Prey energy consumption:  var: prey_energy_consum  category: Prey ;   vegetation_cell grid We add a new variable for the vegetation_cell grid called neighbours, that contains for each vegetation cell the list of the neighbor vegetation cells (distance of 2 - Von Neumann neighborhood). We will use these neighbors list for the movement of the prey.     grid vegetation_cell width: 50 height: 50 neighbours: 4 {       ...       list<vegetation_cell> neighbours <- self neighbours_at 2;    }   Note that the result of the operator neighbours_at dist depends on the type of topology of the agent applying this operator:   * For a grid topology (grid species), the operator returns the neighbor cells (with a Von Neumann or Moore neighborhood).   * For a continuous topology, the operator returns the list of agents of which the shape is located at a distance equals or inferior dist meters to the agent shape.  Also note the use of the self pseudo variable which is a reference to the agent currently executing the statement  Prey agents  We copy the values of the three global parameters into the prey species in order for it to be available for each agent and possibly modified locally.  species prey {    ...    float max_energy <- prey_max_energy ;    float max_transfer <- prey_max_transfer ;    float energy_consum <- prey_energy_consum ;    ... }     The energy used by each prey at each timestep is randomly computed initially (within 0;max_energy).  species prey {    ...    float energy <- (rnd(1000) / 1000) * max_energy  update: energy - energy_consum max: max_energy ;    ... }       In order to define the movement behaviour of a prey we will add a reflex. A reflex is a block of statements (that can be defined in global or any species) that will be automatically executed at each simulation step if its condition is true, it is defined as follows:     reflex reflex_name when: condition {...}   The when facet is optional: when it is omitted, the reflex is activated at each time step. Note that if several reflexes are defined for a species, the reflexes will be activated following their definition order.  We define a first reflex called basic_move that allows the prey agents to choose (randomly) a new vegetation_cell in the neighborhood of my_cell and to move to this cell.  species prey {    ...    reflex basic_move {  myCell <- one_of (myCell.neighbours) ; location <- myCell.location ;    } }   We define a second reflex called eat that will only be activated when there is food in my_cell and that will allows the prey agents to eat food and gain energy. In order to store the energy gain by the eating (that is equals to the minimum between the max_transfer value and the quantity of food available in myCell), we define a local variable called energy_transfer.  A local variable is a variable that will only exist within this block: once it has been executed, the variable is forgotten. To define it, we have to use the following statement:  var_type var_name <- value;    Thus, the reflex eat is defined by:  species prey {    ...    reflex eat when: myCell.food > 0 { float energy_transfer <- min(max_transfer, myCell.food) ;       myCell.food <- myCell.food - energy_transfer ;       energy <- energy + energy_transfer ;    } }   We define a third reflex for the prey agent: when the agent has no more energy, it dies (application of the built-in die action):  species prey {    ...    reflex die when: energy <= 0 {       do die ;    } }   Note that an action is a capability available to the agents of a species (what they can do). It is a block of statements that can be used and reused whenever needed. Some actions, called primitives, are directly coded in Java: for instance, the die action defined for all the agents.   * An action can accept arguments. For instance, write takes an argument called message.   * An action can return a result.  There are two ways to call an action: using a statement or as part of an expression   * for actions that do not return a result:  do action_name arg1: v1 arg2: v2;      for actions that return a result:  my_var <- self action_name (arg1:v1, arg2:v2);    Complete Model      model prey_predator  global {  int nb_preys_init <- 200;  float prey_max_energy <- 1.0;  float prey_max_transfer <- 0.1;  float prey_energy_consum <- 0.05;  init {  create prey number: nb_preys_init ; } }   species prey {  float size <- 1.0 ;  rgb color <- #blue;  float max_energy <- prey_max_energy ;  float max_transfer <- prey_max_transfer ;  float energy_consum <- prey_energy_consum ;  vegetation_cell myCell <- one_of (vegetation_cell) ;  float energy <- (rnd(1000) / 1000) * max_energy  update: energy - energy_consum max: max_energy ;   init {   location <- myCell.location; }   reflex basic_move {   myCell <- one_of (myCell.neighbours) ;  location <- myCell.location ; } reflex eat when: myCell.food > 0 {   float energy_transfer <- min(max_transfer, myCell.food) ;  myCell.food <- myCell.food - energy_transfer ;  energy <- energy + energy_transfer ; } reflex die when: energy <= 0 {  do die ; }  aspect base {  draw circle(size) color: color ; } }   grid vegetation_cell width: 50 height: 50 neighbours: 4 {  float maxFood <- 1.0 ;  float foodProd <- (rnd(1000) / 1000) * 0.01 ;  float food <- (rnd(1000) / 1000) max: maxFood update: food + foodProd ;  rgb color <- rgb(int(255 * (1 - food)), 255, int(255 * (1 - food))) update: rgb(int(255 * (1 - food)), 255, int(255 *(1 - food))) ;  list neighbours  <- (self neighbours_at 2); }  experiment prey_predator type: gui {  parameter  Initial number of preys:   var: nb_preys_init min: 1 max: 1000 category:  Prey  ;  parameter  Prey max energy:   var: prey_max_energy category:  Prey  ;  parameter  Prey max transfer:   var: prey_max_transfer  category:  Prey  ;  parameter  Prey energy consumption:   var: prey_energy_consum  category:  Prey  ;  output {   display main_display {    grid vegetation_cell lines: #black ;    species prey aspect: base ;   }  } }     ","url":"wiki/PredatorPrey_step3.md"},{"id":"wiki/PredatorPrey_step5.md","title":" 5.

The update facet allows to give a behavior to the agents. Indeed, at each simulation step, each agent is activated (by default, in a random order) and first applies for each dynamic variable (in their definition order) its update expression. In the present case, it allows us to link the displayed color of the cell to its food level.     grid vegetation_cell width: 50 height: 50 neighbours: 4 {       float maxFood <- 1.0 ;       float foodProd <- (rnd(1000) / 1000) * 0.01 ;       float food <- (rnd(1000) / 1000) update: food + foodProd max: maxFood;       rgb color <- rgb(int(255 * (1 - food)), 255, int(255 * (1 - food))) update: rgb(int(255 * (1 - food)), 255, int(255 * (1 - food))) ;    }   There are several ways to define colors in GAML:   * the simplest way consists in using the symbol # + the color name (for a limited set of  colors):     #blue    #red    * Another way consists in defining the 3 rgb integer values: rgb(red, green, blue) with red, green and blue between 0 and 255 (as we used in the current model.     rgb(0,0,0) : black ; rgb(255,255,255) : white    rgb(255,0,0) : red ;  rgb(0,255,0) : green ;  rgb(0,0,255) : blue   prey agents In order to relate our prey agents to the vegetation cell grid, we add them with one new variable : my_cell of type vegetation_cell and for init value one of the vegetation_cell (chosen randomly).      species prey {       ...       vegetation_cell myCell <- one_of (vegetation_cell) ;    }    It is possible to obtain the list of all agents of a given species by using the name of the species while one_of to pick one element randomly from this list.  We linked each prey agent to a vegetation_cell but we need to locate them onto the cell. To do so, we set the prey location as equals to the location of the vegetation cell (i.e. its centroid location), we use in the init block the <- statement that allows to modify the value of a variable :  species prey {      ...      init {   location <- myCell.location;      } }   display In order to visualize the vegetation , we need to add it to the display. We use for that the statement grid with the optional facet lines to draw the border of the cells. Note that grid agents have built-in aspect thus it is not necessary to define one.     output {       display main_display {   grid vegetation_cell lines: #black;   species prey aspect: base ;       }    }   Note that the layers in a display work like layers in a GIS; the drawing order will be respected. In our model, the prey agents will be drawn above the vegetation_cell grid thus they need to be declared afterward.

Complex Behavior","content":"8. Complex Behavior This eighth step Illustrates how to define and call actions and how to use conditional statements.  Formulation    Definition of more complex behaviors for prey and predator agents:  The preys agents are moving to the cell containing the highest quantity of food       The predator agents are moving if possible to a cell that contains preys; otherwise random cell Model Definition  parent species We modify the basic_move reflex of the generic_species in order to give the prey and predator a more complex behaviors: instead of choose a random vegetation cell in the neighborhood, the agent will choose a vegetation cell (still in the neighborhood) thanks to a choose_cell action. This action will be specialized for each species.         species generic_species {  …  reflex basic_move {   myCell <- choose_cell();   location <- myCell.location;   }  vegetation_cell choose_cell {  return nil; }     ...    }       We remind that an action is a capability available to the agents of a species (what they can do). It is a block of statements that can be used and reused whenever needed.   * An action can accept arguments.   * An action can return a result (statement return)  There are two ways to call an action: using a statement or as part of an expression   * for actions that do not return a result:  do action_name (arg1: v1 arg2: v2); do action_name (v1, v2);      for actions that return a result (which is stored in my_var):  my_var <- action_name (arg1:v1, arg2:v2); my_var <- action_name (v1, v2);    prey species We specialize the choose_cell species for the prey species: the agent will choose the vegetation cell of the neighborhood (list myCell.neighbours) that maximizes the quantity of food.  Note that GAMA offers numerous operators to manipulate lists and containers:   * Unary operators : min, max, sum…   * Binary operators :     * where : returns a sub-list where all the elements verify the condition defined in the right operand.     * first_with : returns the first element of the list that verifies the condition defined in the right operand.     * … In the case of binary operators, each element (of the first operand list) can be accessed with the keyword each  Thus the choose_cell action of the prey species is defined by:     species prey parent: generic_species {       ...  vegetation_cell choose_cell {    return (myCell.neighbours) with_max_of (each.food);       }       ...    }   predator species We specialize the choose_cell species for the predator species: the agent will choose, if possible, a vegetation cell of the neighborhood (list myCell.neighbours) that contains at least a prey agent; otherwise it will choose a random cell.  We use for this action the first_with operator on the list neighbor vegetation cells (myCell.neighbours) with the following condition: the list of prey agents contained in the cell is not empty. Note that we use the shuffle operator to randomize the order of the list of neighbor cell.  If all the neighbor cells are empty (myCell_tmp = nil, nil is the null value), then the agent choosse a random cell in the neighborhood (one_of (myCell.neighbours)).  GAMA contains statements that allow to execute blocks depending on some conditions:     if condition1 {...}     else if condition2{...}     ...     else {...}    This statement means that if condition1 = true then the first block is executed; otherwise if condition2 = true, then it is the second block, etc. When no conditions are satisfied and an else block is defined (it is optional), this latter is executed.  We then write the choose_cell action as follows:     species predator parent: generic_species {       ...       vegetation_cell choose_cell {    vegetation_cell myCell_tmp <- shuffle(myCell.neighbours) first_with (!(empty (prey inside (each))));    if myCell_tmp != nil {   return myCell_tmp;    } else {   return one_of (myCell.neighbours);    } }       ...    }   Note there is ternary operator allowing to directly use a condition structure to evaluate a variable:     condition ? value1 : value2  if condition is true, then returns value1; otherwise, returns value2.

The food level available in a vegetation_cell will be based on the green level of the corresponding pixel in the image. You will be able to use such process to represent existing real environment in your model. We modify the global init of the model in order to cast the image file in a matrix. We use for that the file as_matrix  {nb_cols, nb_lines} operator that allows to convert a file (image, csv) to a matrix composed of nb_cols columns and nb_lines lines.  Concerning the manipulation of matrix, it is possible to obtain the element i,j of a matrix by using my_matrix i,j.  A  grid can be view as spatial matrix: each cell of a grid has two built-in variables grid_x and grid_y that represent the column and line indexes of the cell.     init {       create prey number: nb_preys_init ;       create predator number: nb_predators_init ;       matrix init_data <- map_init as_matrix {50,50};       ask vegetation_cell {   color <- rgb (init_datagrid_x,grid_y) ;   food <- 1 - ((color as list)0 / 255) ;   foodProd <- food / 100 ;       }    }   Conclusion Congratulations, you have complete your first GAMA models!

The building GIS data contain an attribute: the  NATURE  of each building: a building can be either  Residential  or  Industrial . In this model, people agents are moving along the road network. Each morning, they are going to an industrial building to work, and each night they are coming back home. Each time a people agent takes a road, it wears it out.

We made the following modeling choice:   * Simulation step: 1 minute   * People are moving on the roads from building to building   * People use the shortest path to move between buildings   * All people have the same speed and move at constant speed   * Each time, people arrived at a building they are staying a certain time   * The staying time depends on the current hour (lower at 9h - go to work - at 12h go to lunch - at 18h - go back home)   * Infected people are never cured    Step List  This tutorial is composed of 7 steps corresponding to 7 models.

The importation of models is described here  Model Overview The model built in this tutorial concerns the spreading of a flu in the city of Luneray (Normandie, France).    Two layers of GIS data are used: a road layer (polylines) and a building layer (polygons). In this model, people agents are moving from building to building using the road network. Each infected people can infect the neighbor people.  Some data collected concerning Luneray and the disease: * Number of inhabitants: 2147 (source : wikipedia) * Mean speed of the inhabitants (while moving on the road) : 2-5 km/h * The disease - non lethal - is spreading (by air) from people to people * Time to cure the disease: more than 100 days * Infection distance: 10 meters * Infection probability (when two people are at infection distance) : 0.05/ 5 minutes  From the data collected, we made some modeling choice: * Simulation step: 5 minutes * People are moving on the roads from building to building  * People use the shortest path to move between buildings * All people move at constant speed * Each time, people arrived at a building they are staying a certain time  * Infected people are never cured    Step List  This tutorial is composed of 5 steps corresponding to 5 models.

Preys eat grass on the vegetation cells and predators eat preys. At each simulation step, grass grows on the vegetation cells. Concerning the predators and preys, at each simulation step, they move (to a neighbor cell), eat, die if they do not have enough energy, and eventually reproduce.

Database features are implemented in the irit.gaml.extensions.database plug-in with these features:   * Agents can execute SQL queries (create, Insert, select, update, drop, delete) to various kinds of DBMS.   * Agents can execute MDX (Multidimensional Expressions) queries to select multidimensional objects, such as cubes, and return multidimensional cellsets that contain the cube s data . These features are implemented in two kinds of component: skills (SQLSKILL, MDXSKILL) and agent (AgentDB)  SQLSKILL and AgentDB provide almost the same features (a same set of actions on DBMS) but with certain slight differences:     An agent of species AgentDB will maintain a unique connection to the database during the whole simulation. The connection is thus initialized when the agent is created.   In contrast, an agent of a species with the SQLSKILL skill will open a connection each time he wants to execute a query. This means that each action will be composed of three running steps:  Make a database connection.       Execute SQL statement.       Close database connection. > An agent with the SQLSKILL spends lot of time to create/close the connection each time it needs to send a query; it saves the database connection (DBMS often limit the number of simultaneous connections). In contrast, an AgentDB agent only needs to establish one database connection and it can be used for any actions. Because it does not need to create and close database connection for each action: therefore, actions of AgentDB agents are executed faster than actions of SQLSKILL ones but we must pay a connection for each agent. With an inheritance agent of species AgentDB  or an agent of a species using SQLSKILL, we can query data from relational database for creating species, defining environment or analyzing or storing simulation results into RDBMS. On the other hand, an agent of species with MDXKILL supports the OLAP technology to query data from data marts (multidimensional database). The database features help us to have more flexibility in management of simulation models and analysis of simulation results.   Description     Plug-in: irit.gaml.extensions.database   Author: TRUONG Minh Thai, Frederic AMBLARD, Benoit GAUDOU, Christophe SIBERTIN-BLANC   Supported DBMS  The following DBMS are currently supported:   * SQLite   * MySQL Server   * PostgreSQL Server   * SQL Server   * Mondrian OLAP Server   * SQL Server Analysis Services  Note that, other DBMSs require a dedicated server to work while SQLite on only needs a file to be accessed. All the actions can be used independently from the chosen DBMS. Only the connection parameters are DBMS-dependent.  SQLSKILL ### Define a species that uses the SQLSKILL skill  Example of declaration:   species toto skills: SQLSKILL {  //insert your descriptions here }   Agents with such a skill can use additional actions (defined in the skill)  Map of connection parameters for SQL  In the actions defined in the SQLSkill, a parameter containing the connection parameters is required. It is a map with the following key::value pairs:  | Key | Optional | Description | |:——-|:——–|:——————————————————–| | dbtype | No | DBMS type value. Its value is a string. We must use  mysql  when we want to connect to a MySQL. That is the same for  postgres ,  sqlite  or  sqlserver  (ignore case sensitive) | | host  | Yes | Host name or IP address of data server. It is absent when we work with SQlite. | | port  | Yes | Port of connection. It is not required when we work with SQLite.| | database | No | Name of database. It is the file name including the path when we work with SQLite. | | user  | Yes | Username. It is not required when we work with SQLite. | | passwd | Yes | Password. It is not required when we work with SQLite. | | srid    | Yes | srid (Spatial Reference Identifier)  corresponds to a spatial reference system. This value is specified when GAMA connects to spatial database. If it is absent then GAMA uses spatial reference system defined in Preferences->External configuration. | Table 1: Connection parameter description  Example: Definitions of connection parameter      // POSTGRES connection parameter map <string, string>  POSTGRES <-        host :: localhost ,       dbtype :: postgres ,       database :: BPH ,       port :: 5433 ,       user :: postgres ,       passwd :: abc ;  //SQLite map <string, string>  SQLITE <-       dbtype :: sqlite ,      database :: ../includes/meteo.db ;  // SQLSERVER connection parameter map <string, string> SQLSERVER <-       host :: localhost ,      dbtype :: sqlserver ,      database :: BPH ,      port :: 1433 ,      user :: sa ,      passwd :: abc ;  // MySQL connection parameter map <string, string>  MySQL <-       host :: localhost ,      dbtype :: MySQL ,      database ::  , // it may be a null string      port :: 3306 ,      user :: root ,      passwd :: abc ;      Test a connection to database Syntax: > testConnection (params: connection_parameter) The action tests the connection to a given database.   * Return: boolean. It is:     * true: the agent can connect to the DBMS (to the given Database with given name and password)     * false: the agent cannot connect   * Arguments:     * params: (type = map) map of connection parameters   * Exceptions: GamaRuntimeException  Example: Check a connection to MySQL      if (self testConnection(params:MySQL)){  write  Connection is OK  ; }else{  write  Connection is false  ; }       Select data from database Syntax: > select (param: connection_parameter, select: selection_string,values: value_list) The action creates a connection to a DBMS and executes the select statement. If the connection or selection fails then it throws a GamaRuntimeException.   * Return: list < list >. If the selection succeeds, it returns a list with three elements:     * The first element is a list of column name.     * The second element is a list of column type.     * The third element is a data set.   * Arguments:     * params: (type = map) map containing the connection parameters     * select: (type = string) select string. The selection string can contain question marks.     * values: List of values that are used to replace question marks in appropriate. This is an optional parameter.   * Exceptions: GamaRuntimeException  Example: select data from table points   map <string, string>   PARAMS <-  dbtype :: sqlite ,  database :: ../includes/meteo.db ; list<list> t <- list<list> (self select(params:PARAMS,           select:SELECT * FROM points ;));   Example: select data from table point with question marks from table points   map <string, string>   PARAMS <-  dbtype :: sqlite ,  database :: ../includes/meteo.db ; list<list> t <- list<list> (self select(params: PARAMS,     select: SELECT temp_min FROM points where (day>? and day<?);    values: 10,20 ));   Insert data into database Syntax: > insert (param: connection_parameter,  into:  table_name, columns: column_list, values: value _list)_The action creates a connection to a DBMS and executes the insert statement. If the connection or insertion fails then it throws a_GamaRuntimeException.   * Return: int > If the insertion succeeds, it returns a number of records inserted by the insert.   * Arguments:     *params: (type = map) map containing the connection parameters.     *into: (type = string) table name.     *columns: (type=list)  list of column names of table.

Agents with such a skill can use additional actions (defined in the skill)  Map of connection parameters for MDX In the actions defined in the SQLSkill, a parameter containing the connection parameters is required. It is a map with following key::value pairs:       Key       Optional       Description   olaptype       No       OLAP Server type value. Its value is a string. We must use  SSAS/XMLA  when we want to connect to an SQL Server Analysis Services by using XML for Analysis. That is the same for  MONDRIAN/XML  or  MONDRIAN  (ignore case sensitive)       dbtype       No       DBMS type value. Its value is a string. We must use  mysql  when we want to connect to a MySQL. That is the same for  postgres  or  sqlserver  (ignore case sensitive)       host       No       Host name or IP address of data server.       port       No       Port of connection. It is no required when we work with SQLite.       database       No       Name of database. It is file name include path when we work with SQLite.       catalog       Yes       Name of catalog. It is an optional parameter. We do not need to use it when we connect to SSAS via XMLA and its file name includes the path when we connect a ROLAP database directly by using Mondrian API (see Example as below)       user       No       Username.       passwd       No       Password.

It is:     * true: the agent can connect to the DBMS (to the given Database with given name and password)     * false: the agent cannot connect   * Arguments:     * params: (type = map) map of connection parameters   * Exceptions: GamaRuntimeException  Example: Check a connection to MySQL   if (self testConnection(params:MONDIRANXMLA)){  write Connection is OK; }else{  write Connection is false; }    Select data from OLAP database Syntax: > select (param: connection_parameter, onColumns: column_string, onRows: row_string from: cube_string, where: condition_string, values: value_list) The action creates a connection to an OLAP database and executes the select statement. If the connection or selection fails then it throws a GamaRuntimeException.   * Return: list < list >.  If the selection succeeds, it returns a list with three elements:     * The first element is a list of column name.     * The second element is a list of column type.     * The third element is a data set.   * Arguments:     * params: (type = map) map containing the connection parameters     * onColumns: (type = string) declare  the select string on columns. The selection string can contain question marks.     * onRows: (type = string) declare the selection string on rows. The selection string can contain question marks.     * from: (type = string) specify cube where data is selected. The cube_string can contain question marks.     * where_: (type = string) specify the selection conditions. The condiction_string can contains question marks. This is an optional parameter.     *values: List of values that are used to replace question marks if appropriate. This is an optional parameter.   * Exceptions:_GamaRuntimeException  Example: select data from SQL Server Analysis Service via XMLA   if (self testConnection params::SSAS){  list l1  <- list(self select (params: SSAS ,   onColumns:  { Measures.Quantity, Measures.Price },   onRows: { { { Time.Year.All.CHILDREN } *    +  { Product.Product Category.All.CHILDREN } *    +{ Customer.Company Name.&Alfreds Futterkiste,     +Customer.Company Name.&Ana Trujillo Emparedadosy helados,     + Customer.Company Name.&Antonio Moreno Taquería } } }  ,   from : FROM Northwind Star ));  write result1:+ l1; }else {  write Connect error; }   Example: select data from Mondrian via XMLA with question marks in selection   if (self testConnection(params:MONDRIANXMLA)){  list<list> l2  <- list<list> (self select(params: MONDRIANXMLA,   onColumns: {Measures.Unit Sales, Measures.Store Cost, Measures.Store Sales} ,  onRows:  Hierarchize(Union(Union(Union({(Promotion Media.All Media,   + Product.All Products)},   + Crossjoin(Promotion Media.All Media.Children,   + {Product.All Products})),   + Crossjoin({Promotion Media.Daily Paper, Radio, TV},   + Product.All Products.Children)),   + Crossjoin({Promotion Media.Street Handout},    + Product.All Products.Children)))  ,  from: from ?  ,  where : where Time.?  ,  values:Sales,1997));  write result2:+ l2; }else {  write Connect error; }   AgentDB  AgentBD is a built-in species, which supports behaviors that look like actions in SQLSKILL but differs slightly with SQLSKILL in that it uses  only one connection for several actions. It means that AgentDB makes a connection to DBMS and keeps that connection for its later operations with DBMS. ### Define a species that is an inheritance of agentDB Example of declaration:   species agentDB parent: AgentDB {    //insert your descriptions here }    Connect to database  Syntax:     Connect (param: connection_parameter) This action makes a connection to DBMS. If a connection is established then it will assign the connection object into a built-in attribute of species (conn) otherwise it throws a GamaRuntimeException.   * Return: connection   * Arguments:     * params: (type = map) map containing the connection parameters   * Exceptions: GamaRuntimeException Example: Connect to PostgreSQL    // POSTGRES connection parameter map <string, string>  POSTGRES <-      host :: localhost ,     dbtype :: postgres ,     database :: BPH ,     port :: 5433 ,     user :: postgres ,     passwd :: abc ; ask agentDB {       do connect (params: POSTGRES); }   Check agent connected a database or not  Syntax:     isConnected (param: connection_parameter) This action checks if an agent is connecting to database or not.   * Return: Boolean.   If agent is connecting to a database then isConnected returns true; otherwise it returns false.   * Arguments:     * params: (type = map) map containing the connection parameters   Example: Using action executeUpdate do sql commands (create, insert, update, delete and drop).   ask agentDB {  if (self isConnected){     write It already has a connection;  }else{     do connect (params: POSTGRES);  }  }   Close the current connection  Syntax:     close This action closes the current database connection of species. If species does not has a database connection then it throws a GamaRuntimeException.   * Return: null If the current connection of species is close then the action return null value; otherwise it throws a GamaRuntimeException.   Example:   ask agentDB {  if (self isConnected){        do close;  } }   Get connection parameter  Syntax:     getParameter This action returns the connection parameter of species.   * Return: map < string, string >   Example:   ask agentDB {  if (self isConnected){   write the connection parameter:  +(self getParameter);  } }   Set connection parameter  Syntax:     setParameter (param: connection_parameter) This action sets the new values for connection parameter and closes the current connection of species. If it can not close the current connection then it will throw GamaRuntimeException. If the species wants to make the connection to database with the new values then action connect must be called.   * Return: null   * Arguments:     * params: (type = map) map containing the connection parameters   * Exceptions: GamaRuntimeException   Example:   ask agentDB {  if (self isConnected){    do setParameter(params: MySQL);    do connect(params: (self getParameter));  } }   Retrieve data from database by using AgentDB Because of the connection to database of AgentDB is kept alive then AgentDB can execute several SQL queries with only one connection. Hence AgentDB can do actions such as select, insert, executeUpdate with the same parameters of those actions of SQLSKILL except params parameter is always absent.  Examples:   map<string, string> PARAMS <-  dbtype :: sqlite ,  database :: ../../includes/Student.db ; ask agentDB {    do connect (params: PARAMS);    // Create table    do executeUpdate (updateComm: CREATE TABLE registration   + (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, +  first TEXT NOT NULL,  +  last TEXT NOT NULL, +  age INTEGER););    // Insert into     do executeUpdate ( updateComm: INSERT INTO registration + VALUES(100,  Zara ,  Ali , 18););    do insert (into: registration,    columns: id, first, last,    values: 103,  Zaid tim ,  Kha );    // executeUpdate with question marks    do executeUpdate (updateComm: INSERT INTO registration VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?);,     values: 101,  Mr ,  Mme , 45);    //select     list<list> t <- list<list> (self select(    select:SELECT * FROM registration;));     //update      int n <-  executeUpdate (updateComm: UPDATE registration SET age = 30 WHERE id IN (100, 101));      // delete      int n <- executeUpdate ( updateComm: DELETE FROM registration where id=? ,  values: 101 );      // Drop table       do executeUpdate (updateComm: DROP TABLE registration); }   Using database features to define environment or create species  In Gama, we can use results of select action of SQLSKILL or AgentDB to create species or define boundary of environment in the same way we do with shape files. Further more, we can also save simulation data that are generated by simulation including geometry data to database.  Define the boundary of the environment from database    Step 1: specify select query by declaration a map object with keys as below: Key       Optional       Description   dbtype       No       DBMS type value. Its value is a string. We must use  mysql  when we want to connect to a MySQL. That is the same for  postgres ,  sqlite  or  sqlserver  (ignore case sensitive)       host       Yes       Host name or IP address of data server. It is absent when we work with SQlite.       port       Yes       Port of connection. It is not required when we work with SQLite.       database       No       Name of database. It is the file name including the path when we work with SQLite.       user       Yes       Username. It is  not required when we work with SQLite.       passwd       Yes       Password. It is  not required when we work with SQLite.       srid       Yes       srid (Spatial Reference Identifier)  corresponds to a spatial reference system. This value is specified when GAMA connects to spatial database. If it is absent then GAMA uses spatial reference system defined in Preferences->External configuration.       select       No       Selection string Table 3: Select boundary parameter description  Example:   map<string,string> BOUNDS <-    // srid :: 32648 ,   host :: localhost ,           dbtype :: postgres ,   database :: spatial_DB ,   port :: 5433 ,           user :: postgres ,   passwd :: tmt ,   select :: SELECT ST_AsBinary(geom) as geom FROM bounds;  ;      Step 2: define boundary of environment by using the map object in first step.    geometry shape <- envelope(BOUNDS);   Note: We can do the same way if we work with MySQL, SQLite, or SQLServer and we must convert Geometry format in GIS database to binary format.

We will use the software QGIS to change the attributes of the OSM file.  From the website openstreetmap.org, we will chose a place (in this example, we will take a neighborhood in New York City). Directly from the website, you can export the chosen area in the osm format.    We have now to manipulate the attributes for the exported osm file. Several software are possible to use, but we will focus on QGIS, which is totally free and provides a lot of possibilities in term of manipulation of data.  Once you have installed correctly QGIS, launch QGIS Desktop, and start to import the topology from the osm file.      A message indicates that the import was successful. An output file .osm.db is created. You have now to export the topology to SpatiaLite.

We will execute the Predator-Prey model, already presented in this tutorial. Headless mode is documented here, with the same model as an example. Here, we focus on the definition of an experiment plan, where the model is run several times. We only consider the shell script execution, not the java command execution.  In headless-mode, GAMA can be seen as any shell command, whose behavior is controlled by passing arguments to it. You must provide 2 arguments :     an **input experiment file **, used to describe the execution plan of your model, its inputs and the expected outputs.   an ** output directory **, where the results of the execution are stored   Headless-mode is a little bit more technical to handle than the general GAMA use-case, and the following commands and code have been solely tested on a Linux Ubuntu 15.04 machine, x86_64 architecture, with kernel 3.19.0-82-generic. Java version is 1.8.0_121 (java version  1.8.0_121 )  You may have to perform some adjustments (such as paths definition) according to your machine, OS, java and GAMA versions and so on.  Setup  GAMA version  Headless mode is frequently updated by GAMA developers, so you have to get the very latest build version of GAMA. You can download it here  https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/releases Be sure to pick the ** Continuous build **  version (The name looks like GAMA1.7_Linux_64_02.26.17_da33f5b.zip) and ** not ** the major release, e.g. GAMA1.7_Linux_64.zip. Big note on Windows OS (maybe on others), GAMA must be placed outside of several sensible folders (Program Files, Program Filesx64, Windows).  RECOMMENED: Place GAMA in Users Folder of windows OS.  gama-headless.sh script setup  The gama-headless.sh script can be found under the headless directory, in GAMA installation directory e.g. :  ~/GAMA/headless/  Modifying the script (a little bit)  The original script looks like this :  #! /bin/bash memory=2048m declare -i i   i=0 echo ${!i}   for ((i=1;i<=$#;i=$i+1)) do if test ${!i} = -m then     i=$i+1     memory=${!i} else     PARAM=$PARAM\\ ${!i}     i=$i+1     PARAM=$PARAM\\ ${!i} fi done   echo ****************************************************************** echo * GAMA version 1.7.0 V7     * echo * http://gama-platform.org  * echo * (c) 2007-2016 UMI 209 UMMISCO IRD/UPMC & Partners    * echo ****************************************************************** passWork=.work$RANDOM   java -cp ../plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher*.jar -Xms512m -Xmx$memory  -Djava.awt.headless=true org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main  -application msi.gama.headless.id4 -data $passWork $PARAM $mfull $outputFile rm -rf $passWork   Notice the final command of the script rm -rf $passWork. It is intended to remove the temporary file used during the execution of the script. For now, we should comment this commmand, in order to check the logs if an error appears : #rm -rf $passWork  Setting the experiment file  Headless mode uses a XML file to describe the execution plan of a model. An example is given in the headless mode documentation page.  The script looks like this : ** N.B. this version of the script, given as an example, is deprecated**  <?xml version=1.0 encoding=UTF-8?> <Experiment_plan> <Simulation id=2 sourcePath=./predatorPrey/predatorPrey.gaml finalStep=1000 experiment=predPrey>  <Parameters>   <Parameter name=nb_predator_init type=INT value=53 />   <Parameter name=nb_preys_init type=INT value=621 />  </Parameters>  <Outputs>   <Output id=1 name=main_display framerate=10 />   <Output id=2 name=number_of_preys framerate=1 />   <Output id=3 name=number_of_predators framerate=1 />   <Output id=4 name=duration framerate=1 />  </Outputs> </Simulation> </Experiment_plan>   As you can see, you need to define 3 things in this minimal example : * Simulation:  its id, path to the model , finalStep (or stop condition), and name of the experiment * Parameters name, of the model for * this * simulation (i.e. Simulation of id= 2) * Outputs of the model: their id, name, type, and the rate (expressed in cycles) at which they are logged in the results file during the simulation  We now describe how to constitute your experiment file.  Experiment File : Simulation  id  For now, we only consider one single execution of the model, so the simulation id is not critical, let it unchanged. Later example will include different simulations in the same experiment file. Simulation id is a string. Don t introduce weird symbols into it.  sourcePath  sourcePath is the relative (or absolute) path to the model file you want to execute headlessly.  Here we want to execute the fourth model of the Predator Prey tutorial suite, located in ~/GAMA/plugins/msi.gama.models_1.7.0.XXXXXXXXXXXX/models/Tutorials/Predator Prey/models (with XXXXXXXXXXXX replaced by the number of the release you downloaded)  So we set sourcePath= ../plugins/msi.gama.models_1.7.0.201702260518/models/Tutorials/Predator Prey/models/Model 07.gaml   (Remember that the headless script is located in ~/GAMA/headless/)  Depending on the directory you want to run the gama-headless.sh script, sourcePath must me modified accordingly. Another workaround for shell more advanced users is to define a  $GAMA_PATH, $MODEL_PATH and $OUPUT_PATH in gama-headless.sh script. Don t forget the quotes  around your path.  finalStep  The duration, in cycles, of the simulation.  experiment  This is the name of (one of) the experiment statement at the end of the model code.  In our case there is only one, called prey_predator and  it looks like this :  experiment prey_predator type: gui {  parameter Initial number of preys:  var: nb_preys_init min: 1 max: 1000 category: Prey ;  parameter Prey max energy:  var: prey_max_energy category: Prey ;  parameter Prey max transfert:  var: prey_max_transfert  category: Prey ;  parameter Prey energy consumption:  var: prey_energy_consum  category: Prey ;  output {   display main_display {    grid vegetation_cell lines: #black ;    species prey aspect: base ;   }   monitor Number of preys value: nb_preys ;  } }     So we are now able to constitute the entire Simulation tag :  <Simulation id=2 sourcePath=~/GAMA/plugins/msi.gama.models_1.7.0.201702260518/models/Tutorials/Predator Prey/models/Model 01.gaml finalStep=1000 experiment=prey_predator>  N.B. the numbers after msi.gama.models (the number of your GAMA release actually) have to be adapted to your own release of GAMA number. The path to the GAMA installation directory has also to be adapted of course.  Experiment File : Parameters  The parameters section of the experiment file describes the parameters names, types and values to be passed to the model for its execution.  Let s say we want to fix the number of preys and their max energy  for this simulation. We look at the experiment section of the model code and use their ** title **.  The title of a parameter is the name that comes right after the parameter statement. In our case,  the strings  Initial number of preys:   and  Prey max energy:   (Mind the spaces, quotes and colon)  The parameters section of the file would look like :  <Parameters>  <Parameter name=Initial number of preys:  type=INT value=621 />  <Parameter name=Prey max energy:  type=FLOAT value=1.0 /> </Parameters>   Any declared parameter can be set this way, yet you don t have to set all of them, provided they are initialized with a default value in the model (see the global statement part of the model code).  Experiment File : Outputs  Output section of the experiment file is pretty similar to the previous one, except for the id that have to be set for each of the outputs .  We can log some of the declared outputs  : main_display and number_of_preys.  The outputs section would look like the following:  <Outputs>  <Output id=1 name=main_display framerate=10 />  <Output id=2 name=Number of preys framerate=1 /> </Outputs>   Outputs must have an id, a name, and a framerate.     id is a number that identifies the output   framerate is the rate at which the output is written in the result file. It s a number of cycle of simulation (integer). In this example the display is saved every 10 cycle   name is either the  title  of the corresponding monitor. In our case, the second output s is the title of the monitor Number of preys, i.e.  Number of preys    We also save a **display ** output, that is an image of the simulation graphical display named main_display in the code of the model. Theses images is what you would have seen if you had run the model in the traditional GUI mode.  Execution and results  Our new version of the experiment file is ready :                                      Execution  We have to launch the gama-headless.sh script and provide two arguments : the experiment file we just completed and the path of a directory where the results will be written.  ** Warning ** In this example ,we are lazy and define the source path as the absolute path to the model we want to execute. If you want to use a relative path, note that it has to be define relatively to the location of your ** ExperimentFile.xml location ** (and the location where you launched the script)  In a terminal, position yourself in the headless directory :  ~/GAMA/headless/ .  Then type the following command :  bash gama-headless.sh -v ~/a/path/to/MyExperimentFile.xml  /path/to/the/desired/output/directory     And replace paths by the location of your ExperimentFile and output directory  You should obtain the following output in the terminal :  ****************************************************************** * GAMA version 1.7.0 V7     * * http://gama-platform.org  * * (c) 2007-2016 UMI 209 UMMISCO IRD/UPMC & Partners    * ****************************************************************** >GAMA plugin loaded in 2927 ms:  msi.gama.core >GAMA plugin loaded in 67 ms:  ummisco.gama.network >GAMA plugin loaded in 56 ms:  simtools.gaml.extensions.traffic >GAMA plugin loaded in 75 ms:  simtools.gaml.extensions.physics >GAMA plugin loaded in 1 ms:  irit.gaml.extensions.test >GAMA plugin loaded in 75 ms:  ummisco.gaml.extensions.maths >GAMA plugin loaded in 47 ms:  msi.gaml.extensions.fipa >GAMA plugin loaded in 92 ms:  ummisco.gama.serialize >GAMA plugin loaded in 49 ms:  irit.gaml.extensions.database >GAMA plugin loaded in 2 ms:  msi.gama.lang.gaml >GAMA plugin loaded in 1 ms:  msi.gama.headless >GAMA plugin loaded in 103 ms:  ummisco.gama.java2d >GAMA plugin loaded in 189 ms:  msi.gaml.architecture.simplebdi >GAMA plugin loaded in 129 ms:  ummisco.gama.opengl >GAMA building GAML artefacts>GAMA total load time 4502 ms.  in 714 ms cpus :8 Simulation is running... ....................................................................................................

Going further  Experiments of several simulation  You can launch several simulation by replicating the simulation declaration in your ExperimentFile.xml and varying the values of the parameters. Since you will have to edit the experiment file by hand, you should do that only for a reasonable number of simulations (e.g. <10 )  Design of experiments plans  For more systematic parameter values samples, you should turn towards a more adapted tool such as GAMAR, to generate a ExperimentFile.xml with a huge number of simulations.

Basic Example: A fire rescue model using cognitive agent  We introduce a simple example to illustrate the use of the BDI architecture.  This simple model consists in creating  cognitive  agent whose goal is to extinguish a fire. In a first approximation we consider only one static water area and fire area. The aim is not to have a realistic model but to illustrate how to give a  cognitive  behavior to an agent using the BDI architecture.  First let s create a BDI agent using the key control simple_bdi (A description of all existing control architectures is available here.)  Species Helicopter creation   species helicopter skills:moving control: simple_bdi{ ... }   Attributes The species helicopter needs 2 attributes to represent the water value and its speed.  float waterValue; float speed <- 10.0;   Predicates The predicate are the structure that are used to define a belief, a desire or an intention. In this model we choose to declare 3 different predicates.   predicate patrol_desire <- new_predicate(patrol) with_priority 1; predicate water_predicate <- new_predicate(has water, true) with_priority 3; predicate no_water_predicate <- new_predicate(has water, false) ;  The new_predicate() tool creates a predicate. It needs a name (string type) and it can contain a map of values, a priority (double type) or a truth value (boolean type). The with_priority tool add a priority to a predicate. The priority is used as an argument when the agent has to choose between two predicates (to choose an intention for example).  Initialization The initialization consists in setting the attribute waterValue to 1 and to add one desire. Three optional parameters are also set. The first desire added in the desire base is the patrol_desire saying that the helicopter wants to patrol. The optional parameters are specific to the BDI plug-in. You can specify the commitment of an agent to his intentions and his plans with the variables intention_persistence and plan_persistence that are floats between 0.0 (no commitment) and 1.0. The variable probabilistic_choice is a boolean that enables the agent to use a probabilistic choice (when true) or a deterministic choice (when false) when trying to find a plan or an intention.  waterValue <-1.0; do add_desire(patrol_desire); intention_persistence <- 1.0; plan_persistence <- 1.0; probabilistic_choice <- false;    Perception At each iteration, the helicopter has two perceptions to do. The first one is about itself. The helicopter needs to perceive if it has water or not. If it has water, it adds the belief corresponding belief and removes the belief that it does not have water. And if it does not have water, that is the contrary.  perceive target:self{  if(waterValue>0){   do add_belief(water_predicate);   do remove_belief(no_water_predicate);  }  if(waterValue<=0){   do add_belief(no_water_predicate);   do remove_belief(water_predicate);  } }  The second perception is about the fires. Here, the fires are represented with the species fireArea. The helicopter has a radius of perception of 10 meters. If it perceives a fire, it will focus on the location of this fire. The focus tool create a belief with the same name as the focus (here,  fireLocation ) and will store the value of the focused variable (here, the variable location from the specie fireArea) with a priority of 10 in this example. Once the fire is perceived, the helicopter removes its intention of patrolling.  perceive target:fireArea in: 10{  focus fireLocation var:location priority:10;  ask myself{   do remove_intention(patrol_desire, true);  } }   Rules The agent can use rules to create desires from beliefs. In this example, the agent has two rules. The first rule is to have a desire corresponding to the belief of a location of a fire. It means that when the agent has the belief that there is a fire in a particular location, it will have the desire to extinguish it. This permits to have the location value in the desire base. The second rule is to create the desire to have water when the agent has the belief that it not has water.   rule belief: new_predicate(fireLocation) new_desire: get_belief_with_name(fireLocation); rule belief: no_water_predicate new_desire: water_predicate;   Plan ##### Patrolling This plan will be used when the agent has the intention to patrol.  plan patrolling intention: patrol_desire{   do wander; }  ##### stopFire This plan is executed when the agent has the intention to extinguish a fire.  plan stopFire intention: new_predicate(fireLocation) {  point target_fire <- point(get_current_intention().valueslocation_value );  if(waterValue>0){   if (self distance_to target_fire <= 1) {    fireArea current_fire <- fireArea first_with (each.location = target_fire);    if (current_fire != nil) {      waterValue <- waterValue - 1.0;      current_fire.size <-  current_fire.size - 1;      if ( current_fire.size <= 0) {      ask  current_fire {do die;}      do remove_belief(get_current_intention());      do remove_intention(get_current_intention(), true);      do add_desire(patrol_desire);     }    } else {     do remove_belief(get_current_intention());     do remove_intention(get_current_intention(), true);     do add_desire(patrol_desire);    }   } else {    do goto target: target_fire;   }  } else {   do add_subintention(get_current_intention(),water_predicate,true);   do current_intention_on_hold();  } }  ##### gotoTakeWater This plan is executed when the agent has the intention to have water.  plan gotoTakeWater intention: water_predicate {      waterArea wa <- first(waterArea);  do goto target: wa);      if (self distance_to wa <= 1) {       waterValue <- waterValue + 2.0;  } }  Plans can have other options. They can have a priority (with the facet priority), a boolean condition to start (with the facet when) or a boolean condition to stop (with the facet finished_when).

Defining a micro-model Defining a micro-model of comodel is to import an existing model with an alias name. The syntax is:   import <path to the GAML model> as <identifier>  The identifier is then become the new name of the micro-model.  Instantiate a micro-model After the importation and giving an identifier, micro-model must be explicitly instantiated. It could be done by create statement.   create <micro-model identifier> . <experiment name> optional parameter;  THe  is an expriment inside micro-model. This syntax will generate an experiment agent and attach an implicitly simulation.  Note: Creation of multi-instant is not create multi-simulation, but multi-experiment.

The use of the advanced driving skill requires to use 3 skills:   * Advanced driving skill: dedicated to the definition of the driver species. It provides the driver agents with variables and actions allowing to move an agent on a graph network and to tune its behavior.   * Road skill: dedicated to the definition of roads. It provides the road agents with variables and actions allowing to registers agents on the road.   * RoadNode skill: dedicated to the definition of node. It provides the node agents with variables allowing to take into account the intersection of roads and the traffic signals.  Table of contents     Advanced Driving Skill  Structure of the network: road and roadNode skills       Advanced driving skill       Application example Structure of the network: road and roadNode skills The advanced driving skill is versatile enough to be usable with most of classic road GIS data, in particular OSM data. We use a classic format for the roads and nodes. Each road is a polyline composed of road sections (segments). Each road has a target node and a source node. Each node knows all its input and output roads. A road is considered as directed. For bidirectional roads, 2 roads have to be defined corresponding to both directions. Each road will be the linked_road of the other. Note that for some GIS data, only one road is defined for bidirectional roads, and the nodes are not explicitly defined. In this case, it is very easy, using the GAML language, to create the reverse roads and the corresponding nodes (it only requires few lines of GAML).  images/roads_structure.PNG  A lane can be composed of several lanes and the vehicles will be able to change at any time its lane. Another property of the road that will be taken into account is the maximal authorized speed on it. Note that even if the user of the plug-in has no information about these values for some of the roads (the OSM data are often incomplete), it is very easy using the GAML language to fill the missing value by a default value. It is also possible to change these values dynamically during the simulation (for example, to take into account that after an accident, a lane of a road is closed or that the speed of a road is decreased by the authorities).  images/roads.PNG  The road skill provides the road agents with several variables that will define the road properties:   * lanes: integer, number of lanes.   * maxspeed: float; maximal authorized speed on the road.   * linked_road: road agent; reverse road (if there is one).   * source_node: node agent; source node of the road.   * target_node: node agent; target node of the road.  It provides as well the road agents with one read only variable:   * agents_on: list of list (of driver agents); for each lane, the list of driver agents on the road.  The*roadNode skillprovides the road agents with several variables that will define the road properties:   **roads_in**: list of road agents; the list of road agents that have this node for target node.   **roads_out: list of road agents; the list of road agents that have this node for source node.   *stop: list of list of road agents; list of stop signals, and for each stop signal, the list of concerned roads.**  It provides as well the road agents with one read only variable:     block: map: key: driver agent, value: list of road agents; the list of driver agents blocking the node, and for each agent, the list of concerned roads.   Advanced driving skill Each driver agent has a planned trajectory that consists in a succession of edges. When the driver agent enters a new edge, it first chooses its lane according to the traffic density, with a bias for the rightmost lane. The movement on an edge is inspired by the Intelligent Driver Model. The drivers have the possibility to change their lane at any time (and not only when entering a new edge).  The advanced driving skill provides the driver agents with several variables that will define the car properties and the personality of the driver:   * final_target: point; final location that the agent wants to reach (its goal).   * vehicle_length: float; length of the vehicle.   * max_acceleration: float; maximal acceleration of the vehicle.   * max_speed: float; maximal speed of the vehicle.   * right_side_driving: boolean; do drivers drive on the right side of the road?   * speed_coef: float; coefficient that defines if the driver will try to drive above or below the speed limits.   * security_distance_coeff: float; coefficient for the security distance. The security distance will depend on the driver speed and on this coefficient.   * proba_lane_change_up: float; probability to change lane to a upper lane if necessary (and if possible).   * proba_lane_change_down: float; probability to change lane to a lower lane if necessary (and if possible).   * proba_use_linked_road: float; probability to take the reverse road if necessary (if there is a reverse road).   * proba_respect_priorities: float; probability to respect left/right (according to the driving side) priority at intersections.   * proba_respect_stops: list of float; probabilities to respect each type of stop signals (traffic light, stop sign…).   * proba_block_node: float; probability to accept to block the intersecting roads to enter a new road.  It provides as well the driver agents with several read only variables:     speed: float; speed expected according to the road max_value, the car properties, the personality of the driver and its real_speed.   real_speed: float; real speed of the car (that takes into account the other drivers and the traffic signals).   current_path: path (list of roads to follow); the path that the agent is currently following.   current_target: point; the next target to reach (sub-goal). It corresponds to a node.   targets: list of points; list of locations (sub-goals) to reach the final target.   current_index: integer; the index of the current goal the agent has to reach.   on_linked_road: boolean; is the agent on the linked road?   Of course, the values of these variables can be modified at any time during the simulation. For example, the probability to take a reverse road (proba_use_linked_road) can be increased if the driver is stucked for several minutes behind a slow vehicle.  In addition, the advanced driving skill provides the driver agents with several actions:   * compute_path: arguments: a graph and a target node. This action computes from a graph the shortest path to reach a given node.   * drive: no argument. This action moves the driver on its current path according to the traffic condition and the driver properties (vehicle properties and driver personality).  the drive action works as follow: while the agent has the time to move (remaining_time > 0), it first defines the speed expected. This speed is computed from the max_speed of the road, the current real_speed, the max_speed, the max_acceleration and the speed_coef of the driver (see Equation 1).      speed_driver = Min(max_speed_driver, Min(real_speed_driver + max_acceleration_driver,max_speed_road * speed_coef_driver))       Then, the agent moves toward the current target and compute the remaining time. During the movement, the agents can change lanes (see below). If the agent reaches its final target, it stops; if it reaches its current target (that is not the final target), it tests if it can cross the intersection to reach the next road of the current path. If it is possible, it defines its new target (target node of the next road) and continues to move.  images/drive_action.png  The function that defines if the agent crosses or not the intersection to continue to move works as follow: first, it tests if the road is blocked by a driver at the intersection (if the road is blocked, the agent does not cross the intersection). Then, if there is at least one stop signal at the intersection (traffic signal, stop sign…), for each of these signals, the agent tests its probability to respect or not the signal (note that the agent has a specific probability to respect each type of signals). If there is no stopping signal or if the agent does not respect it, the agent checks if there is at least one vehicle coming from a right (or left if the agent drives on the left side) road at a distance lower than its security distance. If there is one, it tests its probability to respect this priority. If there is no vehicle from the right roads or if it chooses to do not respect the right priority, it tests if it is possible to cross the intersection to its target road without blocking the intersection (i.e. if there is enough space in the target road). If it can cross the intersection, it crosses it; otherwise, it tests its probability to block the node: if the agent decides nevertheless to cross the intersection, then the perpendicular roads will be blocked at the intersection level (these roads will be unblocked when the agent is going to move).  images/stop_at_intersection.png  Concerning the movement of the driver agents on the current road, the agent moves from a section of the road (i.e. segment composing the polyline) to another section according to the maximal distance that the agent can moves (that will depend on the remaining time). For each road section, the agent first computes the maximal distance it can travel according the remaining time and its speed. Then, the agent computes its security distance according to its speed and its security_distance_coeff. While its remaining distance is not null, the agent computes the maximal distance it can travel (and the corresponding lane), then it moves according to this distance (and update its current lane if necessary). If the agent is not blocked by another vehicle and can reach the end of the road section, it updates its current road section and continues to move.  images/follow_driving.png  The computation of the maximal distance an agent can move on a road section consists in computing for each possible lane the maximal distance the agent can move. First, if there is a lower lane, the agent tests the probability to change its lane to a lower one. If it decides to test the lower lane, the agent computes the distance to the next vehicle on this lane and memorizes it. If this distance corresponds to the maximal distance it can travel, it chooses this lane; otherwise it computes the distance to the next vehicle on its current lane and memorizes it if it is higher than the current memorized maximal distance. Then if the memorized distance is lower than the maximal distance the agent can travel and if there is an upper lane, the agents tests the probability to change its lane to a upper one. If it decides to test the upper lane, the agent computes the distance to the next vehicle on this lane and memorizes it if it is higher than the current memorized maximal distance. At last, if the memorized distance is still lower than the maximal distance it can travel, if the agent is on the highest lane and if there is a reverse road, the agent tests the probability to use the reverse road (linked road). If it decides to use the reverse road, the agent computes the distance to the next vehicle on the lane 0 of this road and memorizes the distance if it is higher than the current memorized maximal distance.  images/define_max_dist.png  Application example  We propose a simple model to illustrate the driving skill. We define a driver species. When a driver agent reaches its destination, it just chooses a new random final target. In the same way, we did not define any specific behavior to avoid traffic jam for the driver agents: once they compute their path (all the driver agents use for that the same road graph with the same weights), they never re-compute it even if they are stucked in a traffic jam. Concerning the traffic signals, we just consider the traffic lights (without any pre-processing: we consider the raw OSM data). One step of the simulation represents 1 second. At last, in order to clarify the explanation of the model, we chose to do not present the parts of the GAML code that concern the simulation visualization.  images//sim_snapshot.png  The following code shows the definition of species to represent the road infrastructure:     species road skills: skill_road {    string oneway; }  species node skills: skill_road_node {   bool is_traffic_signal;   int time_to_change <- 100;   int counter <- rnd (time_to_change) ;  reflex dynamic when: is_traffic_signal {     counter <- counter + 1;     if (counter >= time_to_change) { counter <- 0;       stop0 <-empty(stop0)? roads_in : ;     }    } }      In order to use our driving skill, we just have to add the skill_road_node to the node species and the skill_road to the road species. In addition, we added to the road species a variable called oneway that will be initialized from the OSM data and that represents the traffic direction (see the OSM map features for more details). Concerning the node, we defined 3 new attributes:     is_traffic_signal: boolean; is the node a traffic light?   time_to_change: integer; represents for the traffic lights the time to pass from the red light to the green light (and vice versa).   counter: integer;  number of simulation steps since the last change of light color (used by the traffic light nodes).   In addition, we defined for the node species a reflex (behavior) called dynamic that will be activated only for traffic light nodes and that will increment the counter value. If this counter is higher than time_to_change, this variable is set to 0, and the node change the value of the stop variable: if the traffic light was green (i.e. there is no road concerns by this stop sign), the list of block roads is set by all the roads that enter the node; if the traffic light was red (i.e. there is at least one road concerns by this stop sign), the list of block roads is set to an empty list.  The following code shows the definition of driver species:      species driver skills: advanced_driving {    reflex time_to_go when: final_target = nil {     current_path <- compute_path(  graph: road_network, target: one_of(node));   }   reflex move when: final_target != nil {     do drive;   } }       In order to use our driving plug-in, we just have to add the advanced_driving to the driver species. For this species, we defined two reflexes:   * time_to_go: activated when the agent has no final target. In this reflex, the agent will randomly choose one of the nodes as its final target, and computed the path to reach this target using the   * road_network graph. Note that it will have been possible to take into account the knowledge that each agent has concerning the road network by defining a new variable of type map (dictionary) containing for each road a given weight that will reflect the driver knowledge concerning the network (for example, the known traffic jams, its favorite roads….) and to use this map for the path computation.   * move: activated when the agent has a final target. In this reflex, the agent will drive in direction of its final target.  We describe in the following code how we initialize the simulation:     init {   create node from: file( nodes.shp ) with:     is_traffic_signal::read( type )= traffic_signals ;  create road from: file( roads.shp )      with:lanes::int(read( lanes )),      maxspeed::float(read( maxspeed )),      oneway::string(read( oneway ))      {       switch oneway {  match  no  { create road {   lanes <- myself.lanes;   shape <- polyline(reverse     (myself.shape.points));   maxspeed <- myself.maxspeed;   linked_road <- myself;   myself.linked_road <- self; }  }  match  -1  { shape <- polyline(reverse(shape.points));  }       }     }    }     map general_speed_map <-  road as_map     (each::(each.shape.perimeter/(each.maxspeed)));  road_network <-  (as_driving_graph(road, node))      with_weights general_speed_map;  create driver number: 10000 {      location <- one_of(node).location;     vehicle_length <- 3.0;     max_acceleration <- 0.5 + rnd(500) / 1000;     speed_coeff <- 1.2 - (rnd(400) / 1000);     right_side_driving <- true;     proba_lane_change_up <- rnd(500) / 500;     proba_lane_change_down <- 0.5+ (rnd(250) / 500);     security_distance_coeff <- 3 - rnd(2000) / 1000);     proba_respect_priorities <- 1.0 - rnd(200/1000);     proba_respect_stops <- 1.0 - rnd(2) / 1000;     proba_block_node <- rnd(3) / 1000;     proba_use_linked_road <- rnd(10) / 1000;   }  }       In this code, we create the node agents from the node shapefile (while reading the attributes contained in the shapefile), then we create in the same way the road agents. However, for the road agents, we use the oneway variable to define if we should or not reverse their geometry (oneway =  -1 ) or create a reverse road (oneway =  no ). Then, from the road and node agents, we create a graph (while taking into account the maxspeed of the road for the weights of the edges). This graph is the one that will be used by all agents to compute their path to their final target. Finally, we create 1000 driver agents. At initialization, they are randomly placed on the nodes; their vehicle has a length of 3m; the maximal acceleration of their vehicle is randomly drawn between 0.5 and 1; the speed coefficient of the driver is randomly drawn between 0.8 and 1.2; they are driving on the right side of the road; their probability of changing lane for a upper lane is randomly drawn between 0 and 1.0; their probability of changing lane for a lower lane is randomly drawn between 0.5 and 1.0; the security distance coefficient is randomly drawn between 1 and 3; their probability to respect priorities is randomly drawn between 0.8 and 1; their probability to respect light signal is randomly drawn between 0.998 and 1; their probability to block a node is randomly drawn between 0 and 0.003;  their probability to use the reverse road is randomly drawn between 0 and 0.01;  The complete code of the model with the data can be found here ","url":"wiki/UsingDrivingSkill.md"},{"id":"wiki/ManipulateDates.md","title":" Manipulate Dates","content":"# Manipulate Dates  ## Managing Time in Models  If some models are based on a abstract time - only the number of cycles is important - others are based on a real time. In order to manage the time, GAMA provides some tools to manage time.  First, GAMA allows to define the duration of a simulation step. It provides access to different time variables. At last, since GAMA 1.7, it provides a date variable type and some global variables allowing to use a real calendar to manage time.  Definition of the step and use of temporal unity values GAMA provides three important global variables to manage time:     cycle (int - not modifiable): the current simulation step - this variable is incremented by 1 at each simulation step   step (float - can be modified): the duration of a simulation step (in seconds). By default the duration is one second.   time (float - not modifiable): the current time spent since the beginning of the simulation - this variable is computed at each simulation step by: time = cycle * step.   The value of the cycle and time variables are shown in the top left (green rectangle) of the simulation interface. Clicking on the green rectangle allows to display either the number cycles or the time variable. Concerning this variable, it is presented following a years - month - days - hours - minutes - seconds format. In this presentation, every months are considered as being composed of 30 days (the different number of days of months are not taken into account).  Concerning the step facet, the variable can be modified by the modeler. A classic way of doing it consists in reediting the variable in the global section:   global { float step <- 1 #hour; }   In this example, each simulation step will represent 1 hour. This time will be taken into account for all actions based on time (e.g. moving actions).  Note that the value of the step variable should be given in seconds. To facilitate the definition of the step value and of all expressions based on time, GAMA provides different built-in constant variables accessible with the  #  symbol:     #s : second - 1 second   #mn : minute - 60 seconds   #hour : hour - 60 minutes - 3600 seconds   #day : day - 24 hours - 86400 seconds   #month : month - 30 days - 2592000 seconds   #year : year - 12 month - 3.1104E7   The date variable type and the use of a real calendar Since GAMA 1.7, it is possible to use a real calendar to manage the time. For that, the modeler have just to define the starting date of the simulation. This variable is of type date which allow to represent a date and time.  A date variable has several attributes:     year (int): the year component of the date   month (int): the month component of the date   day (int): the day component of the date   hour (int): the hour component of the date   minute (int): the minute component of the date   second (int): the second component of the date   day_of_week (int): the day of the week   week_of_year (int): the week of the year   Several ways can be used to define a date. The simplest consists in using a list of int values: year,month of the year,day of the month, hour of the day, minute of the hour, second of the minute  date my_date <- date(2010,3,23,17,30,10); // the 23th of March 2010, at 17:30:10  Another way consists in using a string with the good format:  date my_date <- date(2010-3-23T17:30:10+07:00);    Note that the current date can be access through the #now built-in variable (variable of type date).  In addition, GAMA provides different useful operators working on dates. For instance, it is possible to compute the duration in seconds between 2 dates using the  -  operator. The result is given in seconds:  float d <- starting_date - my_date;   It is also possible to add or subtract a duration (in seconds) to a date:  write my_date + 10:  + (my_date + 10); write my_date - 10:  + (my_date - 10);   At last, it is possible to add or subtract a duration (in years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes,  seconds) to a date:     write  my_date add_years 1:   + (my_date add_years 1); write  my_date add_months 1:   + (my_date add_months 1); write  my_date add_weeks 1:   + (my_date add_weeks 1); write  my_date add_days 1:   + (my_date add_days 1); write  my_date add_hours 1:   + (my_date add_hours 1); write  my_date add_minutes 1:   + (my_date add_minutes 1); write  my_date add_seconds 1:   + (my_date add_seconds 1);  write  my_date subtract_years 1:   + (my_date subtract_years 1); write  my_date subtract_months 1:   + (my_date subtract_months 1); write  my_date subtract_weeks 1:   + (my_date subtract_weeks 1); write  my_date subtract_days 1:   + (my_date subtract_days 1); write  my_date subtract_hours 1:   + (my_date subtract_hours 1); write  my_date subtract_minutes 1:   + (my_date subtract_minutes 1); write  my_date subtract_seconds 1:   + (my_date subtract_seconds 1);     For the modelers, two global date variable are available: * starting_date: date considered as the beginning of the simulation * current_date: current date of the simulation  By default, these variables are nil. Defining a value of the starting_date allows to change the normal time management of the simulation by a more realistic one (using calendar):   global {      date starting_date <- date(1979,12,17,19,45,10); }   When a variable is set to this variable, the current_date variable is automatically initialized with the same value. However, at each simulation step, the current_date variable is incremented by the step variable. The value of the current_date will replace the value of the time variable in the top left green panel.  Note that you have to be careful, when a real calendar is used, the built-in constants #month and #year should not be used as there are not consistent with the calendar (where month can be composed of 28, 29, 30 or 31 days).

To avoid this issue, you have to disable your video card. This will slow down a bit the performances, but at least you will be able to run GAMA without those annoying crashes.  To disable your video card, open the control panel, click on Hardware and Sound / Devices and Printers / Device manager, and then right click on your video card (as shown in the following image)    ## Grid not displayed right using openGL  When you try to display a grid with opengl, the cells have not a regular shape (as it is shown in the following image)    The reason of this problem is that we can only map a grid of 2^n2^n cells in the plan. Here are some solutions for this problem : - Choose a grid with 2^n2^n dimension (such as 16x16, or 32x32) - Display the grid in java2D - Display the grid as species, and not as grid (note that the difference in term of performance between displaying a grid as a grid and as a species is not so important for opengl displays. It has originally been done for java2D displays) ","url":"wiki/KnownIssues.md"},{"id":"wiki/Diffusion.md","title":" Implementing diffusion","content":"# Implementing diffusion //: # (keyword|concept_grid) //: # (keyword|concept_math) //: # (keyword|concept_topology)  GAMA provides you the possibility to represent and simulate the diffusion of a variable through a grid topology.

It has to be used in a grid species. The diffuse uses the following facets:     var (an identifier), (omissible) : the variable to be diffused   on (any type in container, species): the list of agents (in general cells of a grid), on which the diffusion will occur   avoid_mask (boolean): if true, the value will not be diffused in the masked cells, but will be restitute to the neighboring cells, multiplied by the variation value (no signal lost). If false, the value will be diffused in the masked cells, but masked cells won t diffuse the value afterward (lost of signal). (default value : false)   cycle_length (int): the number of diffusion operation applied in one simulation step   mask (matrix): a matrix masking the diffusion (matrix created from a image for example).

Can have any size, as long as dimensions are odd values.   method (an identifier), takes values in: {convolution, dot_product}: the diffusion method   min_value (float): if a value is smaller than this value, it will not be diffused. By default, this value is equal to 0.0. This value cannot be smaller than 0.   propagation (a label), takes values in: {diffusion, gradient}: represents both the way the signal is propagated and the way to treat multiple propagation of the same signal occurring at once from different places. If propagation equals  diffusion , the intensity of a signal is shared between its neighbors with respect to  proportion ,  variation  and the number of neighbours of the environment places (4, 6 or 8). I.e., for a given signal S propagated from place P, the value transmitted to its N neighbors is : S  = (S / N / proportion) - variation. The intensity of S is then diminished by S * proportion on P. In a diffusion, the different signals of the same name see their intensities added to each other on each place. If propagation equals  gradient , the original intensity is not modified, and each neighbors receives the intensity : S / proportion - variation. If multiple propagation occur at once, only the maximum intensity is kept on each place. If  propagation  is not defined, it is assumed that it is equal to  diffusion .   proportion (float): a diffusion rate   radius (int): a diffusion radius (in number of cells from the center)   variation (float): an absolute value to decrease at each neighbors   To write a diffusion, you first have to declare a grid, and declare a special attribute for the diffusion. You will then have to write the diffuse statement in an other scope (such as the global scope for instance), which will permit the values to be diffused at each step. There, you will specify which variable you want to diffuse (through the var facet), on which species or list of agents you want the diffusion (through the on facet), and how you want this value to be diffused (through all the other facets, we will see how it works with matrix and with special parameters just after).  Here is the template of code we will use for the next following part of this page:      global {  int size <- 64; // the size has to be a power of 2.    cells selected_cells;  // Initialize the emiter cell as the cell at the center of the word init {  selected_cells <- location as cells; } // Affecting 1 to each step reflex new_Value {  ask(selected_cells){   phero <- 1.0;  }  }  reflex diff {  // Declare a diffusion on the grid cells and on quick_cells. The diffusion declared on quick_cells will make 10 computations at each step to accelerate the process.   // The value of the diffusion will be store in the new variable phero of the cell.  diffuse var: phero on: cells /*HERE WRITE DOWN THE DIFFUSION PROPERTIES*/;    } }   grid cells height: size width: size {  //  phero  is the variable storing the value of the diffusion  float phero  <- 0.0;  // The color of the cell is linked to the value of  phero .  rgb color <- hsb(phero,1.0,1.0) update: hsb(phero,1.0,1.0); }  experiment diffusion type: gui {  output {   display a type: opengl {    // Display the grid with elevation    grid cells elevation: phero * 10 triangulation: true;   }  } }      This model will simulate a diffusion through a grid at each step, affecting 1 to the center cell diffusing variable value. The diffusion will be seen during the simulation through a color code, and through the elevation of the cell.  Diffusion with matrix  A first way of specifying the behavior of your diffusion is using diffusion matrix. A diffusion matrix is a 2 dimension matrix nm with float values, where both n and m have to be pair values. The most often, diffusion matrix are square matrix, but you can also declare rectangular matrix.  Example of matrix:   matrix<float> mat_diff <- matrix(   1/9,1/9,1/9,   1/9,1/9,1/9,   1/9,1/9,1/9);   In the diffuse statement, you than have to specify the matrix of diffusion you want in the facet matrix.   diffuse var: phero on: cells matrix:mat_diff;   Using the facet propagation, you can specify if you want the value to be propagated as a diffusion or as a gratient.  Diffusion matrix  A diffusion (the default value of the facet propagation) will spread the values to the neighbors cells according to the diffusion matrix, and all those values will be added together, as it is the case in the following example :    Note that the sum of all the values diffused at the next step is equal to the sum of the values that will be diffused multiply by the sum of the values of the diffusion matrix. That means that if the sum of the values of your diffusion matrix is larger than 1, the values will increase exponentially at each step. The sum of the value of a diffusion matrix is usually equal to 1.  Here are some example of matrix you can use, played with the template model:      Gradient matrix  A gradient (use facet : propagation:gradient) is an other type of propagation. This time, only the larger value diffused will be chosen as the new one.    Note that unlike the diffusion propagation, the sum of your matrix can be greater than 1 (and it is the case, most often !).  Here are some example of matrix with gradient propagation:      Compute multiple propagations at the same step  You can compute several times the propagation you want by using the facet cycle_length. GAMA will compute for you the corresponding new matrix, and will apply it.    Writing those two thinks are exactly equivalent (for diffusion):    matrix<float> mat_diff <- matrix(    1/81,2/81,3/81,2/81,1/81,    2/81,4/81,6/81,4/81,2/81,    3/81,6/81,1/9,6/81,3/81,    2/81,4/81,6/81,4/81,2/81,    1/81,2/81,3/81,2/81,1/81);  reflex diff {   diffuse var: phero on: cells matrix:mat_diff;    matrix<float> mat_diff <- matrix(    1/9,1/9,1/9,    1/9,1/9,1/9,    1/9,1/9,1/9);  reflex diff {   diffuse var: phero on: cells matrix:mat_diff cycle_length:2;   Executing several diffusion matrix  If you execute several times the statement diffuse with different matrix on the same variable, their values will be added (and centered if their dimension is not equal).  Thus, the following 3 matrix will be combined to create one unique matrix:    Diffusion with parameters  Sometimes writing diffusion matrix is not exactly what you want, and you may prefer to just give some parameters to compute the correct diffusion matrix. You can use the following facets in order to do that : propagation, variation and radius.  Depending on which propagation you choose, and how many neighbors your grid have, the propagation matrix will be compute differently. The propagation matrix will have the size : range*2+1.  Let s note P for the propagation value, V for the variation, R for the range and N for the number of neighbors.     With diffusion propagation   For diffusion propagation, we compute following the following steps:  (1) We determine the  minimale  matrix according to N (if N = 8, the matrix will be P/9,P/9,P/9P/9,1/9,P/9P/9,P/9,P/9. if N = 4, the matrix will be 0,P/5,0P/5,1/5,P/50,P/5,0).  (2) If R != 1, we propagate the matrix R times to obtain a 2*R+12*R+1 matrix (same computation as for cycle_length).  (3) If V != 0, we substract each value by V*DistanceFromCenter (DistanceFromCenter depends on N).  Ex with the default values (P=1, R=1, V=0, N=8):     With gradient propagation   The value of each cell will be equal to P/POW(N,DistanceFromCenter)-DistanceFromCenter*V. (DistanceFromCenter depends on N).  Ex with R=2, other parameters default values (R=2, P=1, V=0, N=8):    Note that if you declared a diffusion matrix, you cannot use those 3 facets (it will raise a warning). Note also that if you use parameters, you will only have uniform matrix.  Computation methods  You can compute the output matrix using two computation methods by using the facet method : the dot product and the convolution. Note that the result of those two methods is exactly the same (except if you use the avoid_mask facet, the results can be slightly differents between the two computations).  Convolution  convolution is the default computation method for the diffusion. For every output cells, we will multiply the input values and the flipped kernel together, as shown in the following image :    Pseudo-code (k the kernel, x the input matrix, y the output matrix) :   for (i = 0 ; i < y.nbRows ; i++)   for (j = 0 ; j < y.nbCols ; j++)     for (m = 0 ; m < k.nbRows ; m++)       for (n = 0 ; n < k.nbCols ; n++)  yi,j += kk.nbRows - m - 1, k.nbCols - n - 1    * xi - k.nbRows/2 + m, j - k.nbCols/2 + n   Dot Product  dot_product method will compute the matrix using a simple dot product between the matrix. For every input cells, we multiply the cell by the kernel matrix, as shown in the following image :    Pseudo-code (k the kernel, x the input matrix, y the output matrix) :   for (i = 0 ; i < y.nbRows ; i++)   for (j = 0 ; j < y.nbCols ; j++)     for (m = 0 ; m < k.nbRows ; m++)       for (n = 0 ; n < k.nbCols ; n++)  yi - k.nbRows/2 + m, j - k.nbCols/2 + n += km, n * xi, j   Using mask  Generalities  If you want to propagate some values in an heterogeneous grid, you can use some mask to forbid some cells to propagate their values.  You can pass a matrix to the facet mask. All the values smaller than -1 will not propagate, and all the values greater or equal to -1 will propagate.  A simple way to use mask is by loading an image :    Note that when you use the on facet for the diffuse statement, you can choose only some cells, and not every cells. In fact, when you restrain the values to be diffuse, it is exactly the same process as if you were defining a mask.    When your diffusion is combined with a mask, the default behavior is that the non-masked cells will diffuse their values in all existing cells (that means, even the masked cells !). To change this behavior, you can use the facet avoid_mask. In that case, the value which was supposed to be affected to the masked cell will be redistributed to the neighboring non-masked cells.  Tips  Masks can be used to simulate a lot of environments. Here are some ideas for your models:  Wall blocking the diffusion  If you want to simulate a wall blocking a uniform diffusion, you can declare a second diffusion matrix that will be applied only on the cells where your wall will be. This diffusion matrix will  push  the values outside from himself, but conserving the values (the sum of the values of the diffusion still have to be equal to 1) :      matrix mat_diff <- matrix(    1/9,1/9,1/9,    1/9,1/9,1/9,    1/9,1/9,1/9);  matrix mat_diff_left_wall <- matrix(    0.0,0.0,2/9,    0.0,0.0,4/9,    0.0,0.0,2/9);  reflex diff {   diffuse var: phero on: (cells where(each.grid_x>30)) matrix:mat_diff;  diffuse var: phero on: (cells where(each.grid_x=30)) matrix:mat_diff_left_wall; }        Note that almost the same result can be obtained by using the facet avoid_mask : the value of all masked cells will remain at 0, and the value which was supposed to be affected to the masked cell will be distributed to the neighboring cells. Notice that the results can be slightly different if you are using the convolution or the dot_product method : the algorithm of redistribution of the value to the neighboring cells is a bit different. We advise you to use the dot_product with the avoid_mask facet, the results are more accurates.  Wind pushing the diffusion  Let s simulate a uniform diffusion that is pushed by a wind from  north  everywhere in the grid. A wind from  west  as blowing at the top side of the grid. We will here have to build 2 matrix : one for the uniform diffusion, one for the  north  wind and one for the  west  wind. The sum of the values for the 2 matrix meant to simulate the wind will be equal to 0 (as it will be add to the diffusion matrix).      matrix mat_diff <- matrix(   1/9,1/9,1/9,   1/9,1/9,1/9,   1/9,1/9,1/9);  matrix mat_wind_from_west <- matrix(   -1/9,0.0,1/9,   -1/9,0.0,1/9,   -1/9,0.0,1/9);  matrix mat_wind_from_north <- matrix(   -1/9,-1/9,-1/9,   0.0,0.0,0.0,   1/9,1/9,1/9);  reflex diff {   diffuse var: phero on: cells matrix:mat_diff;  diffuse var: phero on: cells matrix:mat_wind_from_north;  diffuse var: phero on: (cells where (each.grid_y>=32)) matrix:mat_wind_from_west; }        Endless world  Note that when your world is not a torus, it has the same effect as a mask, since all the values outside from the world cannot diffuse some values back :    You can  fake  the fact that your world is endless by adding a different diffusion for the cells with grid_x=0 to have almost the same result :        matrix mat_diff <- matrix(    1/9,1/9,1/9,    1/9,1/9,1/9,    1/9,1/9,1/9);  matrix mat_diff_upper_edge <- matrix(    0.0,0.0,0.0,    1/9+7/81,2/9+1/81,1/9+7/81,    1/9,1/9,1/9);  reflex diff {   diffuse var: phero on: (cells where(each.grid_y>0)) matrix:mat_diff;  diffuse var: phero on: (cells where(each.grid_y=0)) matrix:mat_diff_upper_edge; }      Pseudo code  This section is more for a better understanding of the source code.  Here is the pseudo code for the computation of diffusion :  1) : Execute the statement diffuse, store the diffusions in a map (from class DiffusionStatement to class GridDiffuser) :   - Get all the facet values - Compute the real mask, from the facet mask: and the facet on:.   - If no value for mask: and on: all the grid, the mask is equal to null. - Compute the matrix of diffusion   - If no value for matrix:, compute with nb_neighbors, is_gradient, proportion, propagation, variation, range.   - Then, compute the matrix of diffusion with cycle_length. - Store the diffusion properties in a map   - Map : method_diffu, is_gradient, matrix, mask, min_value is value, var_diffu, grid_name is key.   - If the key exists in the map, try to mix the diffusions     - If method_diffu, mask and is_gradient equal for the 2 diffusions, mix the diffusion matrix.   2) : At the end of the step, execute the diffusions (class GridDiffuser) :   - For each key of the map,   - Load the couple var_diffu / grid_name   - Build the output and input array with the dimension of the grid.    - Initialize the output array with -Double.MAX_VALUE.   - For each value of the map for that key,     - Load all the properties : method_diffu, is_gradient, matrix, mask, min_value     - Compute :       - If the cell is not masked, if the value of input is > min_value, diffuse to the neighbors.  - If the value of the cell is equal to -Double.MAX_VALUE, remplace it by inputidx * matDiffuij.  - Else, do the computation (gradient or diffusion).     - Finish the diffusion :       - If outputidx > -Double.MAX_VALUE, write the new value in the cell.  //: # (endConcept|diffusion) ","url":"wiki/Diffusion.md"},{"id":"wiki/ManipulateLight.md","title":" Implementing light","content":"# Implementing light  When using opengl display, GAMA provides you the possibility to manipulate one or several lights, making your display more realistic.

First of all, you need to know that there are 3 types of lights you can manipulate : the ambient light, the diffuse light and the specular light. Each  light  in opengl is in fact composed of those 3 types of lights.  Ambient light  The ambient light is the light of your world without any lighting. If a face of a cube is not stricken by the light rays for instance, this face will appear totally black if there is no ambient light. To make your world more realistic, it is better to have an ambient light. An ambient light has then no position or direction. It is equally distributed to all the objects of your scene.  Here is an example of our GAML scene using only ambient light (color red) :    Diffuse light  The diffuse light can be seen as the light rays : if a face of a cube is stricken by the diffuse light, it will take the color of this diffuse light. You have to know that the more perpendicular the face of your object will be to the light ray, the more lightened the face will be.  A diffuse light has then a direction. It can have also a position. Your have 2 categories of diffuse light : the positional lights, and the directional lights.  Positional lights  Those lights have a position in your world. It is the case of point lights and spot lights.     Point lights   Points lights can be seen as a candle in your world, diffusing the light equally in all the direction.  Here is an example of our GAML scene using only diffuse light, with a point light (color red, the light source is displayed as a red sphere) :       Spot lights   Spot lights can be seen as a torch light in your world. It needs a position, and also a direction and an angle.  Here is an example of our GAML scene using only diffusion light, with a spot light (color red, the light source is displayed as a red cone) :    Positional lights, as they have a position, can also have an attenuation according to the distance between the light source and the object. The value of positional lights are computed with the following formula : diffuse_light = diffuse_light * ( 1 / (1 + constante_attenuation + linear_attenuation * d + quadratic_attenuation * d)) By changing those 3 values (constante_attenuation, linear_attenuation and quadratic_attenuation), you can control the way light is diffused over your world (if your world is  foggy  for instance, you may turn your linear and quadratic attenuation on). Note that by default, all those attenuation are equal to 0.  Here is an example of our GAML scene using only diffusion light, with a point light with linear attenuation (color red, the light source is displayed as a red sphere) :    Directional lights  Directional lights have no real  position  : they only have a direction. A directional light will strike all the objects of your world with the same direction. An example of directional light you have in the real world would be the light of the sun : the sun is so far away from us that you can consider that the rays have the same direction and the same intensity wherever they strike. Since there is no position for directional lights, there is no attenuation either.  Here is an example of our GAML scene using only diffusion light, with a directional light (color red) :    Specular light  This is a more advanced concept, giving an aspect a little bit  shinny  to the objects stricken by the specular light. It is used to simulate the interaction between the light and a special material (ex : wood, steel, rubber…). This specular light is not implemented yet in gama, only the two others are.  Default light  In your opengl display, without specifying any light, you will have only one light, with those following properties :  Those values have been chosen in order to have the same visual effect in both opengl and java2D displays, when you display 2D objects, and also to have a nice  3D effect  when using the opengl displays. We chose the following setting by default :  * The ambient light value : rgb(127,127,127,255) * diffuse light value : rgb(127,127,127,255) * type of light : direction * direction of the light : (0.5,0.5,-1);  Here is an example of our GAML scene using the default light :    Custom lights  In your opengl display, you can create up to 8 lights, giving them the properties you want.  Ambient light  In order to keep it simple, the ambient light can be set directly when you are declaring your display, through the facet ambient_light. You will have one only ambient light.   experiment my_experiment type:gui {  output {   display my_display type:opengl ambient_light:100 {   }  } }   Note for developers : Note that this ambient light is set to the GL_LIGHT0. This GL_LIGHT0 only contains an ambient light, and no either diffuse nor specular light.  Diffuse light  In order to add lights, or modifying the existing lights, you can use the statement light, inside your display scope :   experiment my_experiment type:gui {  output {   display my_display type:opengl {    light id:0;   }  } }   This statement has just one non-optional facet : the facet  id . Through this facet, you can specify which light you want. You can control 7 lights, through an integer value between 1 and 7. Once you are manipulating a light through the light statement, the light is turned on. To switch off the light, you have to add the facet active, and turn it to false. The light you are declaring through the light statement is in fact a  diffuse  light. You can specify the color of the diffuse light through the facet color (by default, the color will be turn to white). An other very important facet is the type facet. This facet accepts a value among direction, point and spot.  Declaring direction light  A direction light, as explained in the first part, is a light without any position. Instead of the facet position, you will use the facet direction, giving a 3D vector.  Example of implementation :   light id:1 type:direction direction:{1,1,1} color:rgb(255,0,0);   Declaring point light  A point light will need a facet position, in order to give the position of the light source.  Example of implementation of a basic point light :   light id:1 type:point position:{10,20,10} color:rgb(255,0,0);   You can add, if you want, a custom attenuation of the light, through the facets linear_attenuation or quadratic_attenuation.  Example of implementation of a point light with attenuation :   light id:1 type:point position:{10,20,10} color:rgb(255,0,0) linear_attenuation:0.1;   Declaring spot light  A spot light will need the facet position (a spot light is a positionnal light) and the facet direction. A spot light will also need a special facet spot_angle to determine the angle of the spot (by default, this value is set to 45 degree).  Example of implementation of a basic spot light :   light id:1 type:spot position:{0,0,10} direction:{1,1,1} color:rgb(255,0,0) spot_angle:20;   Same as for point light, you can specify an attenuation for a spot light.  Example of implementation of a spot light with attenuation :   light id:1 type:spot position:{0,0,10} direction:{1,1,1} color:rgb(255,0,0) spot_angle:20;   Note that when you are working with lights, you can display your lights through the facet draw light to help you implementing your model. The three types of lights are displayed differently : - The point light is represented by a sphere with the color of the diffuse light you specified, in the position of your light source. - The spot light is represented by a cone with the color of the diffuse light you specified, in the position of your light source, the orientation of your light source. The size of the base of the cone will depend of the angle you specified. - The direction light, as it has no real position, is represented with arrows a bit above the world, with the direction of your direction light, and the color of the diffuse light you specified.    Note for developers : Note that, since the GL_LIGHT0 is already reserved for the ambient light (only !), all the other lights (from 1 to 7) are the lights from GL_LIGHT1 to GL_LIGHT7.       //: # (endConcept       light)   ","url":"wiki/ManipulateLight.md"},{"id":"wiki/AttachingSkills.md","title":" Attaching Skills","content":"# Attaching Skills  GAMA allows to attach skills to agents through the facet skills. Skills are built-in modules that provide a set of related built-in attributes and built-in actions (in addition to those already proposed by GAMA) to the species that declare them.  Index     The moving skill   Other skills   Example of implementation   Skills  A declaration of skill is done by filling the skills facet in the species definition:   species my_species skills: skill1,skill2 { }   A very useful and common skill is the moving skill.   species my_species skills: moving { }   Once your species has the moving skill, it earns automatically the following attributes: speed, heading, destination and the following actions: move, goto, follow, wander and wander_3D.  Attributes:     speed (float) designs the speed of the agent, in m/s.   heading (int) designs the heading of an agent in degrees, which means that is the maximum angle the agent can turn around each step.   destination (point) is the updated destination of the agent, with respect to its speed and heading. It s a read-only attribute, you can t change its value.   Actions:  follow moves the agent along a given path passed in the arguments.     returns: path   speed (float): the speed to use for this move (replaces the current value of speed)   path (path): a path to be followed.   move_weights (map): Weights used for the moving.   return_path (boolean): if true, return the path followed (by default: false)   goto moves the agent towards the target passed in the arguments.     returns: path   target (agent,point,geometry): the location or entity towards which to move.   speed (float): the speed to use for this move (replaces the current value of speed)   on (graph): graph that restrains this move   recompute_path (boolean): if false, the path is not recompute even if the graph is modified (by default: true)   return_path (boolean): if true, return the path followed (by default: false)   move_weights (map): Weights used for the moving.   move moves the agent forward, the distance being computed with respect to its speed and heading.

This is the list of skills: Advanced_driving, communication, driving, GAMASQL, graphic, grid, MDXSKILL, moving, moving3D, physical3D, skill_road, skill_road, skill_road_node, SQLSKILL  Example  We can now build a model using the skill moving. Let s design 2 species, one is  species_red , the other is  species_green .  Species_green agents are moving randomly with a certain speed and a certain heading. Species_red agents wait for a species_green agent to be in a certain range of distance. Once it is the case, the agent move toward the species_green agent. A line link the red_species agent and its target.    Here is an example of implementation:      model green_and_red_species  global{  float distance_to_intercept <- 10.0;  int number_of_green_species <- 50;  int number_of_red_species <- 50;  init {   create speciesA number:number_of_green_species;   create speciesB number:number_of_red_species;  } }  species speciesA skills:moving {  init {   speed <- 1.0;  }  reflex move {   do wander amplitude:90;  }  aspect default {   draw circle(1) color:#green;  } }  species speciesB skills:moving {  speciesA target;  init {   speed <- 0.0;   heading <- 90;  }  reflex search_target when:target=nil {   ask speciesA at_distance(distance_to_intercept) {    myself.target <- self;   }  }  reflex follow when:target!=nil {   speed <- 0.8;   do goto target:target;  }  aspect default {   draw circle(1) color:#red;   if (target!=nil) {    draw polyline(self.location,target.location) color:#black;   }  } }  experiment my_experiment type:gui {  output{   display myDisplay {    species speciesA aspect:default;    species speciesB aspect:default;   }  } }     //: # (endConcept|attaching_skills) ","url":"wiki/AttachingSkills.md"},{"id":"wiki/InteractionBetweenAgents.md","title":" Interaction between agents","content":"# Interaction between agents  In this part, we will learn how interaction between agents works. We will also present you a bunch of operators useful for your modelling.  Index     The ask statement   Pseudo variables   Some useful interaction operators   Example   The ask statement  The ask statement can be used in any reflex or action scope. It is used to specify the interaction between the instances of your species and the other agents. You only have to specify the species of the agents you want to interact with. Here are the different ways of calling the ask statement:     If you want to interact with one particular agent (for example, defined as an attribute of your species):    species my_species {  agent target;  reflex update {   ask target {    // statements   }  } }      If you want to interact with a group of agents:    species my_species {  list<agent> targets;  reflex update {   ask targets {    // statements   }  } }      If you want to interact with agents, as if they were instance of a certain species (can raise an error if it s not the case!):    species my_species {  list<agent> targets;  reflex update {   ask targets as:my_species {    // statements   }  } }      If you want to interact with all the agent of a species:       species my_species {  list targets;  reflex update {   ask other_species {    // statements   }  } }  species other_species { }      Note that you can use the attribute population of species if you find it more explicit:   ask other_species.population      If you want to interact with all the agent of a particular species from a list of agents (for example, using the global variable  agents ):    species my_specie {  reflex update {   ask species of_species my_specie {    // statements   }  } }   Pseudo variables  Once you are in the ask scope, you can use some pseudo variables to refer to the receiver agent (the one specify just after the ask statement) or the transmitter agent (the agent which is asking).  We use the pseudo variable self to refer to the receiver agent, and the pseudo variable myself to refer to the transmitter agent. The pseudo variable self can be omitted when calling actions or attributes.      species speciesA {  init {   name <-  speciesA ;  }  reflex update {   ask speciesB { write name; // output :  speciesB     write self.name; // output :  speciesB     write myself.name; // output :  speciesA    }  } }  species speciesB {  init {   name <-  speciesB ;  } }      Now, if we introduce a third species, we can write an ask statement inside another.      species speciesA {  init {   name <-  speciesA ;  }  reflex update {   ask speciesB {    write self.name; // output :  speciesB     write myself.name; // output :  speciesA     ask speciesC {     write self.name; // output :  speciesC      write myself.name; // output :  speciesB     }   }  } }  species speciesB {  init {   name <-  speciesB ;  } }  species speciesC {  init {   name <-  speciesC ;  } }      Nb: try to avoid multiple imbrications of ask statements. Most of the time, there is another way to do the same thing.  Some useful interaction operators  The operator at_distance can be used to know the list of agents that are in a certain distance from another agent.   species my_species {  reflex update {   list<agent> neighbours <- agents at_distance(5);   // neighbours contains the list of all the agents located at a distance <= 5 from the caller agent.  } }   The operator closest_to returns the closest agent of a position among a container.      species my_species {  reflex update {   agent agentA <- agents closest_to(self);   // agentA contains the closest agent from the caller agent.   agent agentB <- other_specie closest_to({2,3});   // agentB contains the closest instance of other_specie from the location {2,3}.  } }  species other_specie { }      Example  To practice those notions, here is a short basic example. Let s build a model with a fix number of agents with a circle shape. They can move randomly on the environment, and when they are close enough from another agent, a line is displayed between them. This line is destroyed when the distance between the two agents is too important. Hint: use the operator polyline to construct a line. List the points between angle brackets .    Here is one example of implementation:      model connect_the_neighbours  global{  float speed <- 0.2;  float distance_to_intercept <- 10.0;  int number_of_circle <- 100;  init {   create my_species number:number_of_circle;  } }  species my_species {  reflex move {   location <- {location.x+rnd(-speed,speed),location.y+rnd(-speed,speed)};  }  aspect default {   draw circle(1);   ask my_species at_distance(distance_to_intercept) {    draw polyline(self.location,myself.location) color:#black;   }  } }  experiment my_experiment type:gui {  output{   display myDisplay {    species my_species aspect:default;   }  } }     //: # (endConcept|interaction_between_agents) ","url":"wiki/InteractionBetweenAgents.md"},{"id":"wiki/DefiningActionsAndBehaviors.md","title":" Defining actions and behaviors","content":"# Defining actions and behaviors //: # (keyword|concept_behavior)  Both actions and behaviors can be seen as methods in OOP. They can be defined in any species.  Index     Action  Declare an action       Call an action Behavior   Example   Action  Declare an action  An action is a function run by an instance of species. An action can return a value (in that case, the type of return has to be specify just before the name of the action), or not (in that case, you just have to put the keyword action before the name of the action).   species my_species {  int action_with_return_value {   // statements...   return 1;  }  action action_without_return_value {   // statements...  } }   Arguments can also be mandated in your action. You have to specify the type and the name of the argument:   action action_without_return_value (int argA, float argB) {  // statements... }   If you want to have some optional arguments in the list, you can give some by default values to turn them optional. Nb: it is better to define the optional arguments at the end of the list of argument.   action my_action (int argA, float argB <- 5.1, point argC <- {0,0}) {  // statements... }   Call an action  To call an action, you have to use the statement do. You can use the statement do different ways:     With facets : after specifying the name of your action, you can specify the values of your arguments as if the name of your arguments were facets:    do my_action argA:5 argB:5.1;      With parenthesis : after specifying the name of your action, you can specify the values of your arguments in the same order they were declared, between parenthesis:    do my_action (5,5.1);   We incite you to promote the second writing. To catch the returned value, you can also skip the do statement, and store the value directly in a temporary variable:   int var1 <- my_action(5,5.1);   Behavior  A behavior, or reflex, is an action which is called automatically at each time step by an agent.   reflex my_reflex {  write (Executing the inconditional reflex); // statements... }   With the facet when, this reflex is only executed when the boolean expression evaluates to true. It is a convenient way to specify the behavior of agents.   reflex my_reflex when:flip(0.5) {  write (Executing the conditional reflex); // statements... }   Reflex, unlike actions, cannot be called from another context. But a reflex can, of course, call actions.  Nb : Init is a special reflex, that occurs only when the agent is created.  Example  To practice a bit with those notions, we will build an easy example. Let s build a model with a species balloon that has 2 attributes: balloon_size (float) and balloon_color (rgb). Each balloon has a random position and color, his aspect is a sphere. Each step, a balloon has a probability to spawn in the environment. Once a balloon is created, its size is 10cm, and each step, the size increases by 1cm. Once the balloon size reaches 50cm, the balloon has a probability to burst. Once 10 balloons are destroyed, the simulation stops. The volume of each balloon is displayed in the balloon position.    Here is one of the multiple possible implementation:      model burst_the_baloon  global{  float worldDimension <- 5#m;  geometry shape <- square(worldDimension);  int nbBaloonDead <- 0;  reflex buildBaloon when:(flip(0.1)) {  create species:balloon number:1; }  reflex endSimulation when:nbBaloonDead>10 {  do halt; } }   species balloon {  float balloon_size;  rgb balloon_color;  init {   balloon_size <- 0.1;   balloon_color <- rgb(rnd(255),rnd(255),rnd(255));  }  reflex balloon_grow {  balloon_size <- balloon_size + 0.01;  if (balloon_size > 0.5) {   if (flip(0.2)) {    do balloon_burst;   }  } }  float balloon_volume (float diameter) {  float exact_value <- 2/3*#pi*diameter^3;  float round_value <- (round(exact_value*1000))/1000;  return round_value; }  action balloon_burst {  write the baloon is dead !;  nbBaloonDead <- nbBaloonDead + 1;  do die; }  aspect balloon_aspect {  draw circle(balloon_size) color:balloon_color;  draw text:string(balloon_volume(balloon_size)) color:#black; } }   experiment my_experiment type:gui {  output{   display myDisplay {    species balloon aspect:balloon_aspect;   }  } }     //: # (endConcept|actions_and_behaviors) ","url":"wiki/DefiningActionsAndBehaviors.md"},{"id":"wiki/GlobalSpecies.md","title":" The global species","content":"# The global species //: # (keyword|concept_global)  We will start this chapter by studying a special species: the global species.  In the global species you can define the attributes, actions and behaviors that describe the world agent. There is one unique world agent per simulation: it is this agent that is created when a user runs an experiment and that initializes the simulation through its init scope. The global species is a species like other and can be manipulated as them. In addition, the global species automatically inherits from several of built-in variables and actions. Note that a specificity of the global species is that all its attributes can be referred by all agents of the simulation.  Index     Declaration   Environment Size   Built-in Attributes   Built-in Actions   The init statement   Declaration  A GAMA model contains a unique global section that defines the global species.   global {  // definition of global attributes, actions, behaviours }   global can use facets, such as the torus facet, to make the environment a torus or not (if it is a torus, all the agents going out of the environment will appear in the other side. If it s not, the agents won t be able to go out of the environment). By default, the environment is not a torus.     global torus:true {  // definition of global attributes, actions, behaviours }   Other facets such as control or schedules are also available, but we will explain them later.  Directly in the global scope, you have to declare all your global attributes (can be seen as  static members  in Java or C++). To declare them, proceed exactly as for declaring basic variables. Those attributes are accessible wherever you want inside the species scope.  Environment size  In the global context, you have to define a size and a shape for your environment. In fact, an attribute already exists for the global species: it s called shape, and its type is a geometry. By default, shape is equal to a 100m*100m square. You can change the geometry of the shape by affecting another value:   geometry shape <- circle(50#mm); geometry shape <- rectangle(10#m,20#m); geometry shape <- polygon({1°m,2°m},{3°m,50°cm},{3.4°m,60°dm});   nb: there are just examples. Try to avoid mixing dimensions! If no dimensions are specify, it ll be meter by default.  Built-in attributes  Some attributes exist by default for the global species. The attribute shape is one of them (refers to the shape of the environment). Here is the list of the other built-in attributes:  Like the other attributes of the global species, global built-in attributes can be accessed (and sometimes modified) by the world agent and every other agents in the model.  world    represents the sole instance of the model species (i.e. the one defined in the global section). It is accessible from everywhere (including experiments) and gives access to built-in or user-defined global attributes and actions.   ### cycle * integer, read-only, designates the (integer) number of executions of the simulation cycles. Note that the first cycle is the cycle with number 0.  To learn more about time, please read the recipe about dates.  step    float,  is the length, in model time, of an interval between two cycles, in seconds. Its default value is 1 (second). Each turn, the value of time is incremented by the value of step. The definition of step must be coherent with that of the agents  variables like speed. The use of time unit is particularly relevant for its definition.   To learn more about time, please read the recipe about dates.   global { ...     float step <- 10°h; ... }   ### time * float, read-only, represents the current simulated time in seconds (the default unit). It is time in the model time. Begins at zero. Basically, we have:   time = cycle * step  .   global { ...     int nb_minutes function: { int(time / 60)}; ... }   To learn more about time, please read the recipe about dates.  duration    string, read-only, represents the value that is equal to the duration in real machine time of the last cycle.   total_duration    string, read-only, represents the sum of duration since the beginning of the simulation.   average_duration    string, read-only, represents the average of duration since the beginning of the simulation.   ### machine_time * float, read-only, represents the current machine time in milliseconds.  agents    list, read-only, returns a list of all the agents of the model that are considered as  active  (i.e. all the agents with behaviors, excluding the places). Note that obtaining this list can be quite time consuming, as the world has to go through all the species and get their agents before assembling the result. For instance, instead of writing something like:    ask agents of_species my_species { ... }   one would prefer to write (which is much faster):   ask my_species { ... }  Note that any agent has the agents attribute, representing the agents it contains. So to get all the agents of the simulation, we need to access the agents of the world using: world.agents.  ## Built-in Actions The global species is provided with two specific actions.  ### halt * stops the simulation.   global {      ...      reflex halting when: empty (agents) {   do halt;      } }   ### pause * pauses the simulation, which can then be continued by the user.   global {      ...      reflex toto when: time = 100 {   do pause;      } }   ## The init statement  After declaring all the global attributes and defining your environment size, you can define an initial state (before launching the simulation). Here, you normally initialize your global variables, and you instantiate your species. We will see in the next session how to initialize a regular species.  //: # (endConcept|global_species) ","url":"wiki/GlobalSpecies.md"},{"id":"wiki/Inheritance.md","title":" Inheritance","content":"# Inheritance  As for multiple programming language, inheritance can be used in GAML.

Index     Mother species / child species   Virtual actions   Get all the subspecies from a species   Mother species / child species  To make a species inherit from a mother species, you have to add the facet parent, and specify the mother species.      species mother_species { }  species child_species parent:mother_species { }      Thus, all the attributes, actions and reflex of the mother species are inherited to the child species.      species mother_species {  int attribute_A;  action action_A {} }  species child_species parent:mother_species {  init {   attribute_A <- 5;   do action_A;  } }      If the mother species has a particular skill, its children will inherit all the attributes and actions.      species mother_species skills:moving { }  species child_species parent:mother_species {  init {   speed <- 2.0;  }  reflex update {   do wander;  } }      You can redefine an action or a reflex by declaring an action or a reflex with the same name.  Virtual action  You have also the possibility to declare a virtual action in the mother species, which means an action without implementation, by using the facet virtual:   action virtual_action virtual:true;   When you declare an action as virtual in a species, this species becomes abstract, which means you cannot instantiate agent from it. All the children of this species has to implement this virtual action.      species virtual_mother_species {  action my_action virtual:true; }  species child_species parent:virtual_mother_species {  action my_action {   // some statements  } }      Get all the subspecies from a species  If you declare a  mother  species, you create a  child  agent, then  mother  will return the population of agents  mother  and not the population of agents  child , as it is shown in the following example :      global {     init {  create child number:2;  create mother number:1;     }     reflex update {  write length(mother); // will write 1 and not 3     } }  species mother {}  species child parent:mother {}      We reminds you that  subspecies  is a built-in attribute of the agent.

You declare them exactly the way you declare basic variables. Those attributes are accessible wherever you want inside the species scope.   species my_specie {  int variableA; }   Built-in attributes  As for the global species, some attributes exist already by default in a regular species. Here is the list of built-in attributes:     name (type: string) is used to name your agent. By default, the name is equal to the name of your species + an incremental number. This name is the one visible on the species inspector.   location (type: point) is used to control the position of your agent. It refers to the center of the envelop of the shape associated to the agent.   shape (type: geometry) is used to describe the geometry of your agent. If you want to use some intersection operator between agents for instance, it is this geometry that is computed (nb : it can be totally different from the aspect you want to display for your agent !). By default, the shape is a point.   host (type: agent) is used when your agent is part of another agent. We will see this concept a bit further, in the topic multi-level architecture.   All those 4 built-in attributes can be accessed in both reading and writing very easily:   species my_species {  init {   name <- custom_name;   location <- {0,1};   shape <- rectangle(5,1);  } }   All those built-in attributes are attributes of an agent (an instance of a species). Species has also their own attributes, which can be accessed with the following syntax (read only) :   name_of_your_species.attribute_you_want   Notice that the world agent is also an agent ! It has all the built-in attributes declared above. The world agent is defined inside the global scope. From the global scope then, you can for example access to the center of the envelop of the world shape :   global {     init {      write location; // writes {50.0,50.0,0.0}     } }   Here is the list of those attributes:     name (type: string) returns the name of your species   attributes (type: list of string) returns the list of the names of the attributes of your species   population (type: list) returns the list of agent that belong to it   subspecies (type: list of string) returns the list of species that inherit directly from this species (we will talk about the concept of inheritance later)   parent (type: species) returns its parent species if it belongs to the model, or nil otherwise (we will talk about the concept of inheritance later)   ## Built-in action  Some actions are define by default for a minimal agent. We already saw quickly the action write, used to display a message in the console. Another very useful built-in action is the action die, used to destroy an agent.   species my_species{     reflex being_killed {  do die;     } }   Here is the list of the other built-in actions which you can find in the documentation: debug, message, tell.  ## The init statement  After declaring all the attributes of your species, you can define an initial state (before launching the simulation). It can be seen as the  constructor of the class  in OOP.   species my_species {  int variableA;  init {   variableA <- 5;  } }   ## The aspect statement  Inside each species, you can define one or several aspects. This scope allows you to define how you want your species to be represented in the simulation. Each aspect has a special name (so that they can be called from the experiment). Once again, you can name your aspect by using the facet name:, or simply by naming it just after the aspect keyword.   species my_species {  aspect standard_aspect { // or aspect name:standard_aspect  } }   You can then define your aspect by using the statement draw. You can then choose a geometry for your aspect (facet geometry), a color (facet color), an image (facet image), a text (facet text)… We invite you to read the documentation about the draw statement to know more about.   species name:my_species {  aspect name:standard_aspect {   draw geometry:circle(1) color:#blue;  } }   In the experiment scope, you have to tell the program to display a particular species with a particular aspect (nb : you can also choose to display your species with several aspect in the same display).   experiment my_experiment type:gui {  output{   display my_display {    species my_species aspect:standard_aspect;   }  } }   Now there is only one thing missing to display our agent: we have to instantiate them.  Instantiate an agent  As already said quickly in the last session, the instantiation of the agents is most often in the init scope of the global species (this is not mandatory of course. You can instantiate your agents from an action / behavior of any specie). Use the statement create to instantiate an agent.  The facet species is used to specify which species you want to instantiate.  The facet number is used to tell how many instantiation you want.  The facet with is used to specify some default values for some attributes of your instance. For example, you can specify the location.      global{  init{   create species:my_species number:1 with:(location:{0,0},vA:8);  } }  species name:my_specie {  int vA; }      Here is an example of model that display an agent with a circle aspect in the center of the environment:      model display_one_agent  global{  float worldDimension <- 50#m;  geometry shape <- square(worldDimension);  init{   point center <- {(worldDimension/2),(worldDimension/2)};   create species:my_species number:1 with:(location:center);  } }  species name:my_species {  aspect name:standard_aspect {   draw geometry:circle(1#m);  } }  experiment my_experiment type:gui {  output{   display myDisplay {    species my_species aspect:standard_aspect;   }  } }     //: # (endConcept|regular_species) ","url":"wiki/RegularSpecies.md"},{"id":"wiki/OptimizingModels.md","title":" Optimizing Models","content":"# Optimizing Models  This page aims at presenting some tips to optimize the memory footprint or the execution time of a model in GAMA.  Note:  since GAMA 1.6.1, some optimizations have become obsolete because they have been included in the compiler. They have, then, been removed from this page.

The simplest to do that is to use the machine_time built-in global variable that gives the current time in milliseconds. Then to compute the time taken by a statement, a possible way is to write:   float t <- machine_time; // here a block of instructions that you consider as critical // ... write duration of the last instructions:  + (machine_time - t);   ## Scheduling  If you have a species of agents that, once created, are not supposed to do anything more (i.e. no behavior, no reflex, their actions triggered by other agents, their attributes being simply read and written by other agents), such as a  data  grid, or agents representing a  background  (from a shape file, etc.), consider using the schedules:  facet on the definition of their species. This trick allows to tell GAMA to not schedule any of these agents.   grid my_grid height: 100 width: 100 schedules:   {       ... }   The schedules: facet is dynamically computed (even if the agents are not scheduled), so, if you happen to define agents that only need to be scheduled every x cycles, or depending on a condition, you can also write schedules: to implement this. For instance, the following species will see its instances scheduled every 10 steps and only if a certain condition is met:   species my_species schedules: (every 10) ? (condition ? my_species : ) :   {      ... }   In the same way, modelers can use the frequency facet to define when the agents of a species are going to be activated. By setting this facet to 0, the agents are never activated.  species my_species frequency: 0 {      ... }   ## Grid  Optimization Facets In this section, we present some facets that allow to optimize the use of grid (in particular in terms of memories). Note that all these facet can be combined (see the Life model from the Models library).  use_regular_agents If false, then a special class of agents is used. This special class of agents used less memories but has some limitation: the agents cannot inherit from a  normal  species, they cannot have sub-populations, their name cannot be modified, etc.  grid cell width: 50 height: 50 use_regular_agents: false ;   use_individual_shapes If false, then only one geometry is used for all agents. This facet allows to gain a lot of memory, but should not be used if the geometries of the agents are often activated (for instance, by an aspect).   grid cell width: 50 height: 50 use_individual_shapes: false ;    Operators  List operators #### first_with It is sometimes necessary to randomly select an element of a list that verifies a certain condition. Many modelers use the one_of and the where operators to do this:  bug one_big_bug <- one_of (bug where (each.size > 10));  Whereas it is often more optimized to use the shuffle operator to shuffle the list, then the first_with operator to select the first element that verifies the condition:  bug one_big_bug <- shuffle(bug) first_with (each.size > 10);  //: # (keyword|operator_where) //: # (keyword|operator_count) #### where / count It is quite common to want to count the number of elements of a list or a container that verify a condition. The obvious to do it is :  int n <- length(my_container where (each.size > 10));  This will however create an intermediary list before counting it, and this operation can be time consuming if the number of elements is important. To alleviate this problem, GAMA includes an operator called count that will count the elements that verify the condition by iterating directly on the container (no useless list created) :  int n <- my_container count (each.size > 10);  ### Spatial operators //: # (keyword|operator_closest_to) //: # (keyword|operator_at_distance) //: # (keyword|operator_overlapping) //: # (keyword|operator_inside) #### container of agents in closest_to, at_distance, overlapping, inside Several spatial query operators (such as closest_to, at_distance, overlapping or inside) allow to restrict the agents being queried to a container of agents. For instance, one can write:  agent closest_agent <- a_container_containing_agents closest_to self;  This expression is formally equivalent to :  agent closest_agent <- a_container_containing_agent with_min_of (each distance_to self);  But it is much faster if your container is large, as it will query the agents using a spatial index (instead of browsing through the whole container). Note that in some cases, when you have a small number of agents, the first syntax will be faster. The same applies for the other operators.  Now consider a very common case: you need to restrict the agents being queried, not to a container, but to a species (which, actually, acts as a container in most cases). For instance, you want to know which predator is the closest to the current agent. If we apply the pattern above, we would write:  predator closest_predator <- predator with_min_of (each distance_to self);  or  predator closest_predator <- list(predator) closest_to self;   But these two operators can be painfully slow if your species has many instances (even in the second form). In that case, always prefer using directly the species as the left member:  predator closest_ predator <- predator closest_to self;  Not only is the syntax clearer, but the speed gain can be phenomenal because, in that case, the list of instances is not used (we just check if the agent is an instance of the left species).  However, what happens if one wants to query instances belonging to 2 or more species ? If we follow our reasoning, the immediate way to write it would be (if predator 1 and predator 2 are two species):  agent closest_agent <- (list(predator1) + list(predator2)) closest_to self;   or, more simply:  agent closest_agent <- (predator1 + predator2) closest_to self;  The first syntax suffers from the same problem than the previous syntax: GAMA has to browse through the list (created by the concatenation of the species populations) to filter agents. The solution, then, is again to use directly the species, as GAMA is clever enough to create a temporary  fake  population out of the concatenation of several species, which can be used exactly like a list of agents, but provides the advantages of a species population (no iteration made during filtering).  Accelerate closest_to with a first spatial filtering The closest_to operator can sometimes be slow if numerous agents are concerned by this query. If the modeler is just interested by a small subset of agents, it is possible to apply a first spatial filtering on the agent list by using the at_distance operator. For example, if the modeler wants first to do a spatial filtering of 10m:  agent closest_agent <- (predator1 at_distance 10) closest_to self;   To be sure to find an agent, the modeler can use a test statement:  agent closest_agent <- (predator1 at_distance 10) closest_to self; if (closest_agent = nil) {closest_agent  <- predator1 closest_to self;}   ## Displays  ### shape It is quite common to want to display an agent as a circle or a square. A common mistake is to mix up the shape to draw and the geometry of the agent in the model. If the modeler just wants to display a particular shape, he/she should not modify the agent geometry (which is a point by default), but just specify the shape to draw in the agent aspect.      species bug {      int size <- rnd(100);    aspect circle {       draw circle(2) color: °blue;   } }       ### circle vs square / sphere vs cube Note that in OpenGL and Java2D (the two rendering subsystems used in GAMA), creating and drawing a circle geometry is more time consuming than creating and drawing a square (or a rectangle). In the same way, drawing a sphere is more time consuming than drawing a cube. Hence, if you want to optimize your model displays and if the rendering does not explicitly need  rounded  agents, try to use squares/cubes rather than circles/spheres.  ### OpenGL refresh facets In OpenGL display, it is possible to specify that it is not necessary to refresh a layer with the facet refresh. If a species of agents is never modified in terms of visualization (location, shape or color), you can set refresh to false. Example:  display city_display_opengl type: opengl{      species building aspect: base refresh: false;      species road aspect: base refresh: false;      species people aspect: base; }  //: # (endConcept|optimizing_tips) ","url":"wiki/OptimizingModels.md"},{"id":"wiki/RuntimeConcepts.md","title":" Runtime Concepts","content":"# Runtime Concepts  When a model is being simulated, a number of algorithms are applied, for instance to determine the order in which to run the different agents, or the order in which the initialization of agents is performed, etc. This section details some of them, which can be important when building models and understanding how they will be effectively simulated.  Table of contents     Simulation initialization   Agents Creation   Agents Step   Schedule Agents   Simulation initialization Once the user launches an experiment, GAMA starts the initialization of the simulation. First it creates a world agent.  It initializes all its attributes with their init values. This includes its shape (that will be used as environment of the simulation).  If a species of type grid exists in the model, agents of species are created.  Finally the init statement is executed. It should include the creation of all the other agents of regular species of the simulation. After their creation and initialization, they are added in the list members the world (that contains all the micro-agent of the world).  ## Agents Creation Except grid agents, other agents are created using the create statement. It is used to allocate memory for each agent and to initialize all its attributes.  If no explicit initialization exists for an attribute, it will get the default value corresponding to its type.  The initialization of an attribute can be located at several places in the code; they are executed in the following order (which means that, if several ways are used, the attribute will finally have the value of the last applied one): * using the from: facet of the create statement; * in the embedded block of the create statement; * in the attribute declaration, using the init facet; * in the init block of the species.  ## Agents Step When an agent is asked to step, it means that it is expected to update its variables, run its behaviors and then step its micro-agents (if any).      step of agent agent_a     {  species_a <- agent_a.species  architecture_a <- species_a.architecture  ask architecture_a to step agent_a {    ask agent_a to update species_a.variables    ask agent_a to run architecture_a.behaviors  }      ask each micro-population mp of agent_a to step {  list<agent> sub-agents <- mp.compute_agents_to_schedule  ask each agent_b of sub-agents to step //... recursive call...     } }        Schedule Agents  The global scheduling of agents is then simply the application of this previous step to the experiment agent, keeping in mind that this agent has only one micro-population (of simulation agents, each instance of the model species), and that the simulation(s) inside this population contain(s), in turn, all the  regular  populations of agents of the model.  To influence this schedule, then, one possible way is to change the way populations compute their lists of agents to schedule, which can be done in a model by providing custom definitions to the  schedules:  facet of one or several species.  A practical application of this facet is to reduce simulation artifacts created by the default scheduling of populations, which is sequential (i.e. their agents are executed in turn in their order of creation). To enable a pseudo-parallel scheduling based on a random scheduling recomputed at each step, one has simply to define the corresponding species like in the following example:   species A schedules: shuffle(A) {...}   Moving further, it is possible to enable a completely random scheduling that will eliminate the sequential scheduling of populations:      global schedules: world + shuffle(A + B + C) {…}  species A schedules:  {…} species B schedules:  {…} species C schedules:  {…}      It is important to (1) explicitly invoke the scheduling of the world (although it doesn t have to be the first); (2) suppress the population-based scheduling to avoid having agent being scheduled 2 times (one time in the custom definition, one time by their population).  Other schemes are possible. For instance, the following definition will completely suppress the default scheduling mechanism to replace it with a custom scheduler that will execute the world, then all agents of species A in a random way and then all agents of species B in their order of creation:      global schedules: world + shuffle(A) + B {…} // explicit scheduling in the world  species A schedules ;  species B schedules: ;       Complex conditions can be used to express which agents need to be scheduled each step. For instance, in the following definition, only agents of A that return true to a particular condition are scheduled:      species A schedules: A where each.can_be_scheduled() {  bool can_be_scheduled() {      ...      returns true_or_false; } }       Be aware that enabling a custom scheduling can potentially end up in non-functional simulations. For example, the following definitions will result in a simulation that will never be executed:      global schedules:  {}; // the world is NEVER scheduled  species my_scheduler schedules: world ; // so its micro-species  my_scheduler  is NOT scheduled either.       and this one will result in an infinite loop (which will trigger a stack overflow at some point):      global {} // The world is normally scheduled…  species my_scheduler schedules: world; // … but schedules itself again as a consequence of scheduling the micro-species  my_scheduler      //: # (endConcept|runtime_and_schedulers) ","url":"wiki/RuntimeConcepts.md"},{"id":"wiki/ControlArchitecture.md","title":" Control Architectures","content":"# Control Architectures  GAMA allows to attach built-in control architecture to agents.  These control architectures will give the possibility to the modeler to use for a species a specific control architecture in addition to the common behavior structure. Note that only one control architecture can be used per species.  The attachment of a control architecture to a species is done through the facets control.  For example, the given code allows to attach the fsm control architecture to the dummy species.  species dummy control: fsm { }   GAMA integrates several agent control architectures that can be used in addition to the common behavior structure:     fsm: finite state machine based behavior model.

During its life cycle, the agent can be in several states. At any given time step, it is in one single state. Such an agent needs to have one initial state (the state in which it will be at its initialization).  At each time step, the agent will:     first (only if he just entered in its current state) execute statement embedded in the enter statement,   then all the statements in the state statement   it will evaluate the condition of each embedded transition statements. If one condition is fulfilled, the agent execute the embedded statements   Note that an agent executes only one state at each step.  Declaration  Using the FSM architecture for a species require to use the control facet:   species dummy control: fsm {    ... }   State  Attributes    initial: a boolean expression, indicates the initial state of agent.   final: a boolean expression, indicates the final state of agent.   Sub Statements    enter: a sequence of statements to execute upon entering the state.   exit: a sequence of statements to execute right before exiting the state. Note that the exit statement will be executed even if the fired transition points to the same state (the FSM architecture in GAMA does not implement  internal transitions  like the ones found in UML state charts: all transitions, even  self-transitions , follow the same rules).   transition: allows to define a condition that, when evaluated to true, will designate the next state of the life cycle. Note that the evaluation of transitions is short-circuited: the first one that evaluates to true, in the order in which they have been defined, will be followed. I.e., if two transitions evaluate to true during the same time step, only the first one will be triggered.   Things worth to be mentioned regarding these sub-statements:     Obviously, only one definition of exit and enter is accepted in a given state   Transition statements written in the middle of the state statements will only be evaluated at the end, so, even if it evaluates to true, the remaining of the statements found after the definition of the transition will be nevertheless executed. So, despite the appearance, a transition written somewhere in the sequence will  not stop  the state at that point (but only at the end).   Definition A state can contain several statements that will be executed, at each time step, by the agent. There are three exceptions to this rule:     statements enclosed in enter will only be executed when the state is entered (after a transition, or because it is the initial state).   Those enclosed in exit will be executed when leaving the state as a result of a successful transition (and before the statements enclosed in the transition).   Those enclosed in a transition will be executed when performing this transition (but after the exit sequence has been executed).   For example, consider the following example:      species dummy control: fsm {       state state1 initial: true {    write string(cycle) +  :  + name +  ->  +  state1 ;   transition to: state2 when: flip(0.5) {    write string(cycle) +  :  + name +  ->  +  transition to state1 ;   }   transition to: state3 when: flip(0.2) ;   }  state state2 {  write string(cycle) + : + name + -> + state2;  transition to: state1 when: flip(0.5) {    write string(cycle) + : + name + -> + transition to state1;  }  exit {   write string(cycle) + : + name + -> + leave state2;  } }  state state3 {  write string(cycle) + : + name + -> + state3;  transition to: state1 when: flip(0.5)  {   write string(cycle) + : + name + -> + transition to state1;  }  transition to: state2 when: flip(0.2)  ; }    }       the dummy agents start at state1. At each simulation step they have a probability of 0.5 to change their state to state2. If they do not change their state to state2, they have a probability of 0.2 to change their state to state3. In state2, at each simulation step, they have a probability of 0.5 to change their state to state1. At last, in step3, at each simulation step they have a probability of 0.5 to change their state to state1. If they do not change their state to state1, they have a probability of 0.2 to change their state to state2.  Here a possible result that can be obtained with one dummy agent:   0:dummy0->state1 0:dummy0->transition to state1 1:dummy0->state2 2:dummy0->state2 2:dummy0->leave state2 2:dummy0->transition to state1 3:dummy0->state1 3:dummy0->transition to state1 4:dummy0->state2 5:dummy0->state2 5:dummy0->leave state2 5:dummy0->transition to state1 6:dummy0->state1 7:dummy0->state3 8:dummy0->state2  //: # (endConcept|finite_state_machine)  ## Task Based  GAMA integrated several task-based control architectures. Species can define any number of tasks within their body. At any given time, only one or several tasks are executed according to the architecture chosen:     weighted_tasks : in this architecture, only the task with the maximal weight is executed.   sorted_tasks : in this architecture, the tasks are all executed in the order specified by their weights (biggest first)   probabilistic_tasks: this architecture uses the weights as a support for making a weighted probabilistic choice among the different tasks. If all tasks have the same weight, one is randomly chosen each step.   Declaration  Using the Task architectures for a species require to use the control facet:   species dummy control: weighted_tasks {    ... }    species dummy control: sorted_tasks {    ... }    species dummy control: probabilistic_tasks {    ... }   Task  Sub elements Besides a sequence of statements like reflex, a task contains the following sub elements:   * weight: Mandatory. The priority level of the task.  Definition As reflex, a task is a sequence of statements that can be executed, at each time step, by the agent. If an agent owns several tasks, the scheduler chooses a task to execute based on its current priority weight value.  For example, consider the following example:  species dummy control: weighted_tasks {     task task1 weight: cycle mod 3 {    write string(cycle) + : + name + -> + task1;  }  task task2 weight: 2 {    write string(cycle) + : + name + -> + task2;  } }   As the weighted_tasks control architecture was chosen, at each simulation step, the dummy agents execute only the task with the highest behavior. Thus,  when cycle modulo 3 is higher to 2, task1 is executed; when cycle modulo 3 is lower than 2, task2 is executed. In case when cycle modulo 3 is equal 2 (at cycle 2, 5, …), the only the first task defined (here task1) is executed.  Here the result obtained with one dummy agent:  0:dummy0->task2 1:dummy0->task2 2:dummy0->task1 3:dummy0->task2 4:dummy0->task2 5:dummy0->task1 6:dummy0->task2  //: # (endConcept|task_based)  ## User Control Architecture  user_only, user_first, user_last  A specific type of control architecture has been introduced to allow users to take control over an agent during the course of the simulation. It can be invoked using three different keywords: user_only, user_first, user_last.  species user control: user_only {    ... }   If the control chosen is user_first, it means that the user controlled panel is opened first, and then the agent has a chance to run its  own  behaviors (reflexes, essentially, or  init  in the case of a  user_init  panel). If the control chosen is user_last, it is the contrary.  user_panel  This control architecture is a specialization of the Finite State Machine Architecture where the  behaviors  of agents can be defined by using new constructs called user_panel (and one user_init), mixed with  states  or  reflexes . This user_panel translates, in the interface, in a semi-modal view that awaits the user to choose action buttons, change attributes of the controlled agent, etc. Each user_panel, like a state in FSM, can have a enter and exit sections, but it is only defined in terms of a set of user_commands which describe the different action buttons present in the panel.  user_commands can also accept inputs, in order to create more interesting commands for the user. This uses the user_input statement (and not operator), which is basically the same as a temporary variable declaration whose value is asked to the user. Example:  As user_panel is a specialization of state, the modeler has the possibility to describe several panels and choose the one to open depending on some condition, using the same syntax than for finite state machines :   * either adding transitions to the user_panels,   * or setting the state attribute to a new value, from inside or from another agent.  This ensures a great flexibility for the design of the user interface proposed to the user, as it can be adapted to the different stages of the simulation, etc…  Follows a simple example, where, every 10 steps, and depending on the value of an attribute called  advanced , either the basic or the advanced panel is proposed.      species user control:user_only {    user_panel default initial: true {       transition to:  Basic Control  when: every (10) and !advanced_user_control;       transition to:  Advanced Control  when: every(10) and advanced_user_control;    }  user_panel  Basic Control  {       user_command  Kill one cell  {   ask (one_of(cell)){   do die;   }       }       user_command  Create one cell  {  create cell ;       } transition to: default when: true;    }    user_panel  Advanced Control  {       user_command  Kill cells  {  user_input  Number  returns: number type: int <- 10;  ask (number among cell){  do die;  }       }       user_command  Create cells  {  user_input  Number  returns: number type: int <- 10;  create cell number: number ;       } transition to: default when: true;    } }      The panel marked with the  initial: true  facet will be the one run first when the agent is supposed to run. If none is marked, the first panel (in their definition order) is chosen.  A special panel called user_init will be invoked only once when initializing the agent if it is defined. If no panel is described or if all panels are empty (i.e. no user_commands), the control view is never invoked. If the control is said to be  user_only , the agent will then not run any of its behaviors.  user_controlled  Finally, each agent provided with this architecture inherits a boolean attribute called user_controlled. If this attribute becomes false, no panels will be displayed and the agent will run  normally  unless its species is defined with a user_only control. //: # (endConcept|user_control_architecture)  Other Control Architectures  Some other control architectures are available in additional plugins.

Each equation of the ODE system describes the evolution of the number of individual in a compartment. In such an approach individuals are not taken into account individually, with own features and behaviors. In contrary they are aggregated in a compartment and reduced to a number.  A classical example is the SIR epidemic model representing the spreading of a disease in a population. The population is split into 3 compartments: S (Susceptible), I (Infected), R (Recovered). (see below for the equation)  In general the ODE systems cannot be analytically solved, i.e. it is not possible to find the equation describing the evolution of the number of S, I or R. But these systems can be numerically integrated in order to get the evolution. A numerical integration computes step after step the value of S, I and R. Several integration methods exist (e.g. Euler, Runge-Kutta…), each of them being a compromise between accuracy and computation time. The length of the integration step has also a huge impact on precision. These models are deterministic.  This approach makes a lot of strong hypotheses. The model does not take into account space. The population is considered has infinite and homogeneously mixed, so that any agent can interact with any other one.  Example of a SIR model  In the SIR model, the population is split into 3 compartments: S (Susceptible), I (Infected), R (Recovered). This can be represented by the following Forrester diagram: boxes represent stocks (i.e. compartments) and arrows are flows. Arrows hold the rate of a compartment population flowing to another compartment.    The corresponding ODE system contains one equation per stock. For example, the I compartment evolution is influenced by an inner (so positive) flow from the S compartment and an outer (so negative) flow to the R compartment.    Integrating this system using the Runge-Kutta 4 method provides the evolution of S, I and R over time. The initial values are: * S = 499 * I = 1 * R = 0 * beta = 0.4 * gamma = 0.1  * h = 0.1    Why and when can we use ODE in agent-based models ?  These hypotheses are very strong and cannot be fulfilled in agent-based models.  But in some multi-scale models, some entities can be close. For example if we want to implement a model describing the worldwide epidemic spread and the impact of air traffic on it, we cannot simulate the 7 billions people. But we can represent only cities with airports and airplanes as agents. In this case, cities are entities with a population of millions inhabitants, that will not been spatially located. As we are only interested in the disease spread, we are only interested in the number of infected people in the cities (and susceptibles and recovered too). As a consequence, it appears particularly relevant to describe the evolution of the disease in the city using a ODE system.  In addition these models have the advantage to not be sensible to population size in the integration process. Dozens or billions people does not bring a computation time increase, contrarily to agent-based models.  Use of ODE in a GAML model  A stereotypical use of ODE in a GAMA agent-based model is to describe species where some agents attributes evolution is described using an ODE system.  As a consequence, the GAML language has been increased by two main concepts (as two statements): * equations can be written with the equation statement. An equation block is composed of a set of diff statement describing the evolution of species attributes. * an equation can be numerically integrated using the solve statement  equation ### Defining an ODE system Defining a new ODE system needs to define a new equation block in a species. As example, the following eqSI system describes the evolution of a population with 2 compartments (S and I) and the flow from S to I compartment:       species userSI {  float t ;  float I ;   float S ;   int N ;  float beta<-0.4 ;  float h ;  equation eqSI {  diff(S,t) = -beta * S * I / N ;  diff(I,t) = beta * S * I / N ; } }        This equation has to be defined in a species with   t  ,   S   and   I   attributes.   beta   (and other similar parameters) can be defined either in the specific species (if it is specific to each agents) or in the   global   if it is a constant.   Note: the t attribute will be automatically updated using the solve statement ; it contains the time elapsed in the equation integration.  Using a built-in ODE system In order to ease the use of very classical ODE system, some built-in systems have been implemented in GAMA. For example, the previous SI system can be written as follows. Three additional facets are used to define the system: * type: the identifier of the built-in system (here SI) (the list of all built-in systems are described below), * vars: this facet is expecting a list of variables of the species, that will be matched with the variables of the system, * params: this facet is expecting a list of variables of the species (of of the global), that will be matched with the parameters of the system.  equation eqBuiltInSI type: SI vars: S,I,t params: N,beta ;   Split a system into several agents  An equation system can be split into several species and each part of the system are synchronized using the simultaneously facet of equation. The system split into several agents can be integrated using a single call to the solve statement. Notice that all the equation definition must have the same name.  For example the SI system presented above can be defined in two different species S_agt (containing the equation defining the evolution of the S value) and I_agt (containing the equation defining the evolution of the I value). These two equations are linked using the simultaneously facet of the equation statement. This facet expects a set of agents. The integration is called only once in a simulation step, e.g. in the S_agt agent.     species S_agt {  float t ;    float Ssize ;  equation evol simultaneously:  I_agt  {  diff(Ssize, t) = (- sum(I_agt accumulate each.beta * each.Isize) * self.Ssize / N); }  reflex solving {solve evol method : rk4 step : hKR4 ;}  }   species I_agt {  float t ;  float Isize ; // number of infected   float beta ;  equation evol simultaneously :  S_agt  {  diff(Isize, t) = (beta * first(S_agt).Ssize * Isize / N); } }     The interest is that the modeler can create several agents for each compartment, which different values. For example in the SI model, the modeler can choose to create 1 agent  S_agt  and 2 agents  I_agt . The  beta  attribute will have different values in the two agents, in order to represent 2 different strains.       global {  int number_S <- 495 ; // The number of susceptible  int number_I <- 5   ; // The number of infected  int nb_I <- 2;  float gbeta  <- 0.3  ; // The parameter Beta  int N <- number_S + nb_I * number_I ; float hKR4 <- 0.1 ;  init {  create S_agt {   Ssize <- float(number_S) ;  }  create I_agt number: nb_I {   Isize <- float(number_I) ;   self.beta <- myself.gbeta + rnd(0.5) ;  } } }        The results are computed using the RK4 method with: * number_S = 495  * number_I = 5 * nb_I = 2 * gbeta = 0.3  * hKR4 = 0.1    solve an equation The solve statement has been added in order to integrate numerically the equation system. It should be add into a reflex. At each simulation step, a step of the integration is executed, the length of the integration step is defined in the step facet. The solve statement will update the variables used in the equation system. The chosen integration method (defined in method) is Runge-Kutta 4 (which is very often a good choice of integration method in terms of accuracy).  reflex solving {  solve eqSI method:rk4 step:h; }  With a smaller integration step, the integration will be faster but less accurate.  More details  Details about the solve statement  The solve statement can have a huge set of facets (see S_Statements#solve for more details). The basic use of the solve statement requiers only the equation identifier. By default, the integration method is Runge-Kutta 4 with an integration step of 1, which means that at each simulation step the equation integration is made over 1 unit of time (which is implicitly defined by the system parameter value).   solve eqSI ;   2 integration methods can be used:  * method: rk4 will use the Runge-Kutta 4 integration method * method: dp853 will use the Dorman-Prince 8(5,3) integration method. The advantage of this method compared to Runge-Kutta is that it has an evaluation of the error and can use it to adapt the integration step size.  In order to synchronize the simulation step and the equation integration step, 2 facets can be used: * step: number * cycle_length: number  cycle_length (int): length of simulation cycle which will be synchronize with step of integrator (default value: 1) step (float): integration step, use with most integrator methods (default value: 1)  time_final (float): target time for the integration (can be set to a value smaller than t0 for backward integration) time_initial (float): initial time discretizing_step (int): number of discret beside 2 step of simulation (default value: 0) integrated_times (list): time interval inside integration process integrated_values (list): list of variables s value inside integration process  Some facets are specific to the DP853 integration methods: max_step, min_step, scalAbsoluteTolerance and scalRelativeTolerance.  Example of the influence of the integration step  The step and cycle_length facets of the integration method may have a huge influence on the results. step has an impact on the result accuracy. In addition, it is possible to synchronize the step of the (agent-based) simulation and the (equation) integration step in various ways (depending on the modeler purpose) using the cycle_length facet: e.g. cycle_length: 10 means that 10 simulation steps are equivalent to 1 unit of time of the integration method.   solve SIR method: rk4 step: 1.0 cycle_length: 1.0 ;   solve SIR method: rk4 step: 0.1 cycle_length: 10.0 ;   solve SIR method: rk4 step: 0.01 cycle_length: 100.0 ; List of built-in ODE systems Several built-in equations have been defined. #### equation eqBuiltInSI type: SI vars: S,I,t params: N,beta;  This system is equivalent to:  equation eqSI {  diff(S,t) = -beta * S * I / N ;  diff(I,t) = beta * S * I / N ; }       The results are provided using the Runge-Kutta 4 method using following initial values: * S = 499 * I = 1 * beta = 0.4 * h = 0.1    equation eqSIS type: SIS vars: S,I,t params: N,beta,gamma;  This system is equivalent to:  equation eqSIS {  diff(S,t) = -beta * S * I / N + gamma * I;  diff(I,t) = beta * S * I / N - gamma * I; }      The results are provided using the Runge-Kutta 4 method using following initial values: * S = 499 * I = 1 * beta = 0.4 * gamma = 0.1  * h = 0.1    equation eqSIR type:SIR vars:S,I,R,t params:N,beta,gamma ;  This system is equivalent to:  equation eqSIR {  diff(S,t) = (- beta * S * I / N);  diff(I,t) = (beta * S * I / N) - (gamma * I);  diff(R,t) = (gamma * I); }       The results are provided using the Runge-Kutta 4 method using following initial values: * S = 499 * I = 1 * R = 0 * beta = 0.4 * gamma = 0.1  * h = 0.1    equation eqSIRS type: SIRS vars: S,I,R,t params: N,beta,gamma,omega,mu ;  This system is equivalent to:  equation eqSIRS {   diff(S,t) = mu * N + omega * R + - beta * S * I / N - mu * S ;   diff(I,t) = beta * S * I / N - gamma * I - mu * I ;   diff(R,t) = gamma * I - omega * R - mu * R ; }       The results are provided using the Runge-Kutta 4 method using following initial values: * S = 499 * I = 1 * R = 0 * beta = 0.4 * gamma = 0.01 * omega = 0.05 * mu = 0.01  * h = 0.1    equation eqSEIR type: SEIR vars: S,E,I,R,t params: N,beta,gamma,sigma,mu ;  This system is equivalent to:  equation eqSEIR {  diff(S,t) = mu * N - beta * S * I / N - mu * S ;  diff(E,t) = beta * S * I / N - mu * E - sigma * E ;  diff(I,t) = sigma * E - mu * I - gamma * I;  diff(R,t) = gamma * I - mu * R ; }       The results are provided using the Runge-Kutta 4 method using following initial values: * S = 499 * E = 0 * I = 1 * R = 0 * beta = 0.4 * gamma = 0.01 * sigma = 0.05 * mu = 0.01  * h = 0.1    equation eqLV type: LV vars: x,y,t params: alpha,beta,delta,gamma ;  This system is equivalent to:  equation eqLV {   diff(x,t) =   x * (alpha - beta * y);  diff(y,t) = - y * (delta - gamma * x); }      The results are provided using the Runge-Kutta 4 method using following initial values: * x = 2 * y = 2 * alpha = 0.8 * beta = 0.3 * gamma = 0.2 * delta = 0.85 * h = 0.1   //: # (endConcept|equation) ","url":"wiki/Equations.md"},{"id":"wiki/BatchExperiments.md","title":" Defining Batch Experiments","content":"# Defining Batch Experiments  Batch experiments allows to execute numerous successive simulation runs.They are used to explore the parameter space of a model or to optimize a set of model parameters.

Its value is a condition on variables defined in the model. The run will stop when the condition is evaluated to true. If omitted, the first simulation run will go forever, preventing any subsequent run to take place (unless a halt command is used in the model itself). * repeat: (integer) A parameter configuration corresponds to a set of values assigned to each parameter. The attribute repeat specifies the number of times each configuration will be repeated, meaning that as many simulations will be run with the same parameter values. Different random seeds are given to the pseudo-random number generator. This allows to get some statistical power from the experiments conducted. Default value is 1. * keep_seed: (boolean) If true, the same series of random seeds will be used from one parameter configuration to another.

It is possible to override this action to apply a specific action at the end of each simulation. Note that at the experiment level, you have access to all the species and all the global variables._  For instance, the following experiment runs the simulation 5 times, and, at the end of each simulation, saves the people agents in a shapefile.     experiment  Run 5 simulations  type: batch repeat: 5 keep_seed: true until: ( time > 1000 ) {  int cpt <- 0;  action step {   save people type: shp  to: people_shape  + cpt +  .shp  with: is_infected:: INFECTED ,is_immune:: IMMUNE ;   cpt <- cpt + 1;  } }  A second solution to achieve the same result is to use reflexes (see below).      Reflexes It is possible to write reflexes inside a batch experiment. This reflex will be executed at the end of each simulation. For instance, the following reflex writes at the end of each simulation the value of the variable food_gathered:   reflex info_sim {  write Running a new simulation  + simulation +  ->  + food_gathered; }   ## Permanent The permanent section allows to define a output block that will not be re-initialized at the beginning of each simulation but will be filled at the end of each simulation.

GAMA provides you the possibility to launch several simulations from the GUI.  Index     Create a simulation   Manipulate simulations   Random seed  Defining the seed from the model       Defining the seed from the experiment       Run several simulations with the same random numbers       Change the RNG Create a simulation  Let s remind you that in GAMA, everything is an agent. We already saw that the  world  agent is the agent of the model. The model is thus a species, called modelName_model :   model toto // <- the name of the species is toto_model   New highlight of the day : an Experiment is also an agent ! It s a special agent which will instantiate automatically an agent from the model species. You can then perfectly create agents (model agents) from your experiment, using the statement create :      model multi_simulations // the  world  is an instance of the  multi_simulations_model   global { }  experiment my_experiment type:gui  {  init {   create multi_simulations_model;  } }      This sort model will instantiate 2 simulations (two instance of the model) : one is created automatically by the experiment, and the second one is explicitly created through the statement create.  To simplify the syntax, you can use the built-in attribute simulation of your experiment. When you have a model called  multi_simulations , the two following lines are strictly equal :   create multi_simulations_model; create simulation;   As it was the case for creating regular species, you can specify the parameters of your agent during the creation through the facet with: :      model multi_simulations  global {  rgb bgd_color; }  experiment my_experiment type:gui  {  parameter name: background color:  var:bgd_color init:#blue;  init {   create simulation with:bgd_color::#red;  }  output {   display  my_display  background:bgd_color{}  } }      Manipulate simulations  When you think the simulations as agents, it gives you a lot of new possibilities. You can for example create a reflex from your experiment, asking to create simulations during the experiment execution !  The following short model for example will create a new simulation at each 10 cycles :      model multi_simulations  global {  init {   write  new simulation created ! Its name is  +name;  } }  experiment my_experiment type:gui  {  init {  }  reflex when:(mod(cycle,10)=0 and cycle!=0) {   create simulation;  }  output {  } }      You may ask, what is the purpose of such a thing ? Well, with such a short model, it is not very interesting, for sure. But you can imagine running a simulation, and if the simulation reaches a certain state, it can be closed, and another simulation can be run instead with different parameters (a simulation can be closed by doing a  do die  on itself). You can also imagine to run two simulations, and to communicate from one to an other through the experiment, as it is shown in this easy model, where agents can move from one simulation to another :        model smallWorld  global {  int grid_size <- 10;  bool modelleft <- true;  int id<- 0;  int nb_agents <- 50;  init {  create people number: nb_agents {   my_cell <- one_of(cell);   location <- my_cell.location;  }  if (modelleft) {   ask cell where (each.grid_x = (grid_size - 1))  {    color <- #red;    }  } else {   ask cell where (each.grid_x = 0)  {    color <- #red;    }  } }  action changeWorld(rgb color, point loc) {  create people with:color::color, location::loc {   my_cell <- cell(location);  } } }   species people {  rgb color <- rnd_color(255);  cell my_cell;  reflex move {  if (modelleft and my_cell.color = #red) {   ask smallWorld_model1 {    do changeWorld(myself.color, {100 - myself.location.x,myself.location.y});    }    do die;  } else {   list<cell> free_cells <- list<cell> (my_cell.neighbors) where empty(people inside each);   if not empty(free_cells) {    my_cell <- one_of(free_cells);    location <- my_cell.location;   }  }   }  aspect default {  draw circle(50/grid_size) color: color; }  }   grid cell width: grid_size height: grid_size;  experiment fromWorldToWorld type: gui {  init {    create simulation with:grid_size::20, modelleft::false, id::1, nb_agents::0;  }  output {  display map {   grid cell lines: #black;   species people;  } } }       Here is an other example of application of application, available in the model library. Here we run 4 times the Ant Foraging model, with different parameters.  //: # (endConcept       run_simulations_as_agents)       //: # (startConcept       control_randomness) ## Random seed  Defining the seed from the model  If you run several simulations, you may want to use the same seed for each one of those simulations (to compare the influence of a certain parameter, in exactly the same conditions).  Let s remind you that seed is a built-in attribute of the model. You than just need to specify the value of your seed during the creation of the simulation if you want to fix the seed :   create simulation with:seed::10.0;   You can also specify the seed if you are inside the init scope of your global agent.   global {  init {   seed<-10.0;  } }   Notice that if you affect the value of your seed built-in directly in the global scope, the affectation of the parameters (for instance specified with the facet with of the statement create), and the  init  will be done after  will be done at the end.  Defining the seed from the experiment  The experiment agent also have a built-in attribute seed. The value of this seed is defined in your simulation preferences. The first simulation created is created with the seed value of the experiment.  The following sequence diagram can explain you better how the affectation of the seed attribute works :    The affectation of an attribute is always done in this order : (1) the attribute is affected with a specific value in the species scope. If no attribute value is specified, the value is a default value. (2) if a value is specified for this attribute in the create statement, then the attribute value is affected again. (3) the attribute value can be changed again in the init scope.  Run several simulations with the same random numbers  The following code shows how to run several simulations with a specific seed, determined from the experiment agent :      model multi_simulations  global {  init {   create my_species;  } }  species my_species skills:moving {  reflex update {   do wander;  }  aspect base {   draw circle(2) color:#green;  } }  experiment my_experiment type:gui  {  float seedValue <- 10.0;  float seed <- seedValue; // force the value of the seed.  init {   // create a second simulation with the same seed as the main simulation   create simulation with:seed::seedValue;  }  output {   display my_display {    species my_species aspect:base;   }  } }      When you run this simulation, their execution is exactly similar.    Let s try now to add a new species in this model, and to add a parameter to the simulation for the number of agents created for this species.      model multi_simulations  global {  int number_of_speciesB <- 1;  init {   create my_speciesA;   create my_speciesB number:number_of_speciesB;  } }  species my_speciesA skills:moving {  reflex update {   do wander;  }  aspect base {   draw circle(2) color:#green;  } }  species my_speciesB skills:moving {  reflex update {   do wander;  }  aspect base {   draw circle(2) color:#red;  } }  experiment my_experiment type:gui  {  float seedValue <- 10.0;  float seed <- seedValue; // force the value of the seed.  init {   create simulation with:seed::seedValue,number_of_speciesB::2;  }  output {   display my_display {    species my_speciesA aspect:base;    species my_speciesB aspect:base;   }  } }      Then you run the experiment, you may find something strange…    Even if the first step seems ok (the greed agent and one of the two red agent is initialized with the same location), the simulation differs completly. You should have expected to have the same behavior for the greed agent in both of the simulation, but it is not the case. The explaination of this behavior is that a random number generator has generated more random numbers in the second simulation than in the first one.  If you don t understand, here is a short example that may help you to understand better :      model multi_simulations  global {  int iteration_number <- 1;  reflex update {   float value;   loop times:iteration_number {    value<-rnd(10.0);    write value;   }   write  cycle  +cycle+  in experiment  +name+  :  +value;  } }  experiment my_experiment type:gui  {  float seedValue <- 10.0;  float seed <- seedValue; // force the value of the seed.  init {   create simulation with:seed::seedValue,iteration_number::2;  }  output {  } }      The output will be something like that :   7.67003069780383 cycle 0 in experiment multi_simulations_model0 : 7.67003069780383 7.67003069780383 0.22889843360303863 cycle 0 in experiment multi_simulations_model1 : 0.22889843360303863 0.22889843360303863 cycle 1 in experiment multi_simulations_model0 : 0.22889843360303863 4.5220913306263855 0.8363180333035425 cycle 1 in experiment multi_simulations_model1 : 0.8363180333035425 4.5220913306263855 cycle 2 in experiment multi_simulations_model0 : 4.5220913306263855 5.460148568140819 4.158355846617511 cycle 2 in experiment multi_simulations_model1 : 4.158355846617511 0.8363180333035425 cycle 3 in experiment multi_simulations_model0 : 0.8363180333035425 1.886091659169562 4.371253083874633 cycle 3 in experiment multi_simulations_model1 : 4.371253083874633   Which means :       Cycle       Value generated in simulation 0       Value generated in simulation 1   1       7.67003069780383       7.67003069780383                       0.22889843360303863       2       0.22889843360303863       4.5220913306263855                       0.8363180333035425       3       4.5220913306263855       5.460148568140819                       4.158355846617511 When writing your models, you have to be aware of this behavior. Remember that each simulation has it s own random number generator.

If this element is omitted, the batch will run in a classical way, changing one parameter value at each step until all the possible combinations of parameter values have been covered. See the Exhaustive exploration of the parameter space for more details.  When used, this element must contain at least a name attribute to specify the algorithm to use. It has theses facets: * minimize or a maximize (mandatory for optimization method): a attribute defining the expression to be optimized. * aggregation (optional): possible values ( min ,  max ). Each combination of parameter values is tested repeat times. The aggregated fitness of one combination is by default the average of fitness values obtained with those repetitions. This facet can be used to tune this aggregation function and to choose to compute the aggregated fitness value as the minimum or the maximum of the obtained fitness values. * other parameters linked to exploration method (optional) : see below for a description of these parameters.  Exemples of use of the method elements:     method exhaustive minimize: nb_infected ;  method genetic pop_dim: 3 crossover_prob: 0.7 mutation_prob: 0.1 nb_prelim_gen: 1 max_gen: 5  minimize: nb_infected aggregation:  max ;      ## Exhaustive exploration of the parameter space  Parameter definitions accepted: List with step and Explicit List. Parameter type accepted: all.  This is the standard batch method. The exhaustive mode is defined by default when there is no method element present in the batch section. It explores all the combination of parameter values in a sequential way.  Example (models/ants/batch/ant_exhaustive_batch.xml):   experiment Batch type: batch repeat: 2 keep_seed: true until: (food_gathered = food_placed ) or ( time > 400 ) {  parameter  Evaporation:  var: evaporation_rate among:  0.1 , 0.2 , 0.5 , 0.8 , 1.0  unit:  rate every cycle (1.0 means 100%) ;  parameter  Diffusion:  var: diffusion_rate min: 0.1 max: 1.0 unit:  rate every cycle (1.0 means 100%)  step: 0.3; }   The order of the simulations depends on the order of the param. In our example, the first combinations will be the followings: * evaporation_rate = 0.1, diffusion_rate = 0.1, (2 times) * evaporation_rate = 0.1, diffusion_rate = 0.4, (2 times) * evaporation_rate = 0.1, diffusion_rate = 0.7, (2 times) * evaporation_rate = 0.1, diffusion_rate = 1.0, (2 times) * evaporation_rate = 0.2, diffusion_rate = 0.1, (2 times) * …  Note: this method can also be used for optimization by adding an method element with maximize or a minimize attribute:   experiment Batch type: batch repeat: 2 keep_seed: true until: (food_gathered = food_placed ) or ( time > 400 ) {  parameter  Evaporation:  var: evaporation_rate among:  0.1 , 0.2 , 0.5 , 0.8 , 1.0  unit:  rate every cycle (1.0 means 100%) ;  parameter  Diffusion:  var: diffusion_rate min: 0.1 max: 1.0 unit:  rate every cycle (1.0 means 100%)  step: 0.3;  method exhaustive maximize: food_gathered; }   Hill Climbing  Name: hill_climbing Parameter definitions accepted: List with step and Explicit List.

Parameter type accepted: all.  This algorithm is an implementation of the Simulated Annealing algorithm. See the wikipedia article.

Parameter type accepted: all.  This algorithm is a simple implementation of the Reactive Tabu Search algorithm ((Battiti et al., 1993)). This Reactive Tabu Search is an enhance version of the Tabu search. It adds two new elements to the classic Tabu Search. The first one concerns the size of the tabu list: in the Reactive Tabu Search, this one is not constant anymore but it dynamically evolves according to the context. Thus, when the exploration process visits too often the same solutions, the tabu list is extended in order to favor the diversification of the search process. On the other hand, when the process has not visited an already known solution for a high number of iterations, the tabu list is shortened in order to favor the intensification of the search process. The second new element concerns the adding of cycle detection capacities. Thus, when a cycle is detected, the process applies random movements in order to break the cycle.  Method parameters: * iter_max: number of iterations * tabu_list_size_init: initial size of the tabu list * tabu_list_size_min: minimal size of the tabu list * tabu_list_size_max: maximal size of the tabu list * nb_tests_wthout_col_max: number of movements without collision before shortening the tabu list * cycle_size_min: minimal size of the considered cycles * cycle_size_max: maximal size of the considered cycles   experiment Batch type: batch repeat: 2 keep_seed: true until: (food_gathered = food_placed ) or ( time > 400 ) {  parameter  Evaporation:  var: evaporation_rate among:  0.1 , 0.2 , 0.5 , 0.8 , 1.0  unit:  rate every cycle (1.0 means 100%) ;  parameter  Diffusion:  var: diffusion_rate min: 0.1 max: 1.0 unit:  rate every cycle (1.0 means 100%)  step: 0.3;  method reactive_tabu iter_max: 50 tabu_list_size_init: 5 tabu_list_size_min: 2 tabu_list_size_max: 10 nb_tests_wthout_col_max: 20 cycle_size_min: 2 cycle_size_max: 20 maximize: food_gathered; }   Genetic Algorithm Name: genetic Parameter definitions accepted: List with step and Explicit List. Parameter type accepted: all.  This is a simple implementation of Genetic Algorithms (GA). See the wikipedia article. The principle of GA is to search an optimal solution by applying evolution operators on an initial population of solutions There are three types of evolution operators: * Crossover: Two solutions are combined in order to produce new solutions * Mutation: a solution is modified * Selection: only a part of the population is kept. Different techniques can be applied for this selection. Most of them are based on the solution quality (fitness).  Representation of the solutions: * Individual solution: {Param1 = val1; Param2 = val2; …} * Gene: Parami = vali  Initial population building: the system builds nb_prelim_gen random initial populations composed of pop_dim individual solutions. Then, the best pop_dim solutions are selected to be part of the initial population.  Selection operator: roulette-wheel selection: the probability to choose a solution is equals to: fitness(solution)/ Sum of the population fitness. A solution can be selected several times. Ex: population composed of 3 solutions with fitness (that we want to maximize) 1, 4 and 5. Their probability to be chosen is equals to 0.1, 0.4 and 0.5.  Mutation operator: The value of one parameter is modified. Ex: The solution {Param1 = 3; Param2 = 2} can mute to {Param1 = 3; Param2 = 4}  Crossover operator: A cut point is randomly selected and two new solutions are built by taking the half of each parent solution. Ex: let {Param1 = 4; Param2 = 1} and {Param1 = 2; Param2 = 3} be two solutions. The crossover operator builds two new solutions: {Param1 = 2; Param2 = 1} and {Param1 = 4; Param2 = 3}.  Method parameters: * pop_dim: size of the population (number of individual solutions) * crossover_prob: crossover probability between two individual solutions * mutation_prob: mutation probability for an individual solution * nb_prelim_gen: number of random populations used to build the initial population * max_gen: number of generations   experiment Batch type: batch repeat: 2 keep_seed: true until: (food_gathered = food_placed ) or ( time > 400 ) {  parameter  Evaporation:  var: evaporation_rate among:  0.1 , 0.2 , 0.5 , 0.8 , 1.0  unit:  rate every cycle (1.0 means 100%) ;  parameter  Diffusion:  var: diffusion_rate min: 0.1 max: 1.0 unit:  rate every cycle (1.0 means 100%)  step: 0.3;  method genetic maximize: food_gathered pop_dim: 5 crossover_prob: 0.7 mutation_prob: 0.1 nb_prelim_gen: 1 max_gen: 20;  }  //: # (endConcept|exploration_methods) ","url":"wiki/ExplorationMethods.md"},{"id":"wiki/BasicProgrammingConceptsInGAML.md","title":" Basic programming concepts in GAML","content":"# Basic programming concepts in GAML  In this part, we will focus on the very basic structures in GAML, such as how to declare a variable, how to use loops, or how to manipulate lists.  We will overfly quickly all those basic programming concepts, admitting that you already have some basics in coding.  Index     Variables  Basic types       The point type       A word about dimensions Declare variables using facet   Operators in GAMA  Logical operators       Comparison operators       Type casting operators       Other operators Conditional structures   Loop   Manipulate containers   Random values   Variables  Variables are declared very easily in GAML, starting with the keyword for the type, following by the name you want for your variable.  NB: The declaration has to be inside the global scope, or inside the species scope.   typeName myVariableName;   Basic types  All the  basic  types are present in GAML:int, float, string, bool. The operator for the affectation in GAML is <- (the operator = is used to test the equality).   int integerVariable <- 3; float floatVariable <- 2.5; string stringVariable <- test; // you can also write simple   : <-  test  bool booleanVariable <- true; // or false   To follow the behavior of variable, we can write their value in the console. Let s go back to our basic skeleton of a model, and let s create a reflex in the global scope (to be short, a reflex is a function that is executed in each step. We will come back to this concept later). The write function works very easily, simply writing down the keyword write and the name of the variable we want to be displayed.      model firstModel  global {  int integerVariable <- 3;  float floatVariable <- 2.5;  string stringVariable <-  test ; // you can also write simple   : <-  test   bool booleanVariable <- true; // or false  reflex writeDebug {   write integerVariable;   write floatVariable;   write stringVariable;   write booleanVariable;  } }  experiment myExperiment { }      The function write is overloaded for each type of variable (even for the more complex type, such as containers).  Note that before being initialized, a variable has the value nil.   reflex update {  string my_string;  write my_string; // this will write nil.  int my_int;  write my_int; // this will write 0, which is the default value for int. }   nil is also a literal you can use to initialize your variable (you can learn more about the concept of literal in this page).   reflex update {  string my_string <- a string;  my_string <- nil;  write my_string; // this will write nil.  int my_int <- 6;  my_int <- nil;  write my_int; // this will write 0, which is the default value for int. }   ### The point type  Another variable type you should know is the point variable. This type of variable is used to describe coordinates. It is in fact a complex variable, composed of two float variables (or three if you are working in 3D). To declare it, you have to use the curly bracket {:   point p <- {0.2,2.4};   The first field is related to the x value, and the second, to the y value. You can easily get this value as following:   point p <- {0.2,2.4}; write p.x; // the output will be 0.2 write p.y; // the output will be 2.4   You can t modify directly the value. But if you want, you can do a simple operation to get what you want:   point p <- {0.2,2.4}; p <- p + {0.0,1.0}; write p.y; // the output will be 3.4   ### A world about dimensions  When manipulating float values, you can specify the dimension of your value. Dimensions are preceded by # or ° (exactly the same).   float a <- 5°m; float b <- 4#cm; float c <- a + b; // c is equal to 5.0399999 (it s not equal to 5.04 because it is a float value, not as precise as int)   ## Declare variables using facet  Facets are used to describe the behavior of a variable during its declaration, by adding the keyword facet just after the variable name, followed by the value you want for the facet (or also just after the initial value).   type variableName <- initialValue facet1:valueForFacet1 facet2:valueForFacet2; // or: type variableName facet1:valueForFacet1 facet2:valueForFacet2; variableName <- initialValue;   You can use the facet update if you want to change the value of your variable. For example, to increment your integer variable each step, you can do as follow:   int integerVariable <- 3 min:0 max:10 update:integerVariable+1; // nb: the operator ++ doesn t exist in gaml.   You can use the facet min and max to constraint the value in a specific range of values:   int integerVariable <- 3 min:0 max:10 update:integerVariable+1; // the result will be 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 9 - 10 - 10 - 10 - ...   The facet among can also be useful (that can be seen as an enum):   string fruits <- banana among:pear,apple,banana;   ## Operators in GAMA  In GAML language, you can use a lot of different operators. They are all listed in this page, but here are the most useful ones:  - Mathematical operators  The basic arithmetical operators, such as +(add), -(substract), *(multiply), /(divide), ^(power) are used this way:  FirstOperand Operator SecondOperand –> ex: 5 * 3; // return 15  Some other operators, such as cos(cosinus), sin(sinus), tan(tangent), sqrt(square root), round(rounding) etc… are used this way:   Operator(Operand) --> ex: sqrt(49); // return 7   Logical operators  Logical operators such as and(and), or(inclusive or) are used the same way as basic arithmetical operators. The operator !(negation) has to be placed just before the operand. They return a boolean result.   FirstOperand Operator SecondOperand --> ex: true or false; // return true NegationOperator Operand --> ex: !(true or false); // return false   ### Comparison operators  The comparison operators !=(different than), <(smaller than), <=(smaller of equal), =(equal), >(bigger than), >=(bigger or equal) are used the same way as basic arithmetical operators:   FirstOperand Operator SecondOperand --> ex: 5 < 3; // return false   ### Type casting operators  You can cast an operand to a special type using casting operator:   Operator(Operand); --> ex: int(2.1); // return 2   Other operators  A lot of other operators exist in GAML. The standard way to use those operators is as followed:   Operator(FirstOperand,SecondOperand,...) --> ex: rnd(1,8);   Some others are used in a more intuitive way:   FirstOperand Operator SecondOperand --> ex: 26,4,5 contains(5);   ## Conditional structures  You can write if/else if/else in GAML:   if (integerVariable<0) {  write my value is negative !! The exact value is  + integerVariable; } else if (integerVariable>0) {  write my value is positive !! The exact value is  + integerVariable; } else if (integerVariable=0) {  write my value is equal to 0 !!; } else {  write hey... This is not possible, right ?; }   GAML also accepts ternary operator:   stringVariable <- (booleanVariable) ? booleanVariable = true : booleanVariable = false;   ## Loop  Loops in GAML are designed by the keyword loop. As for variables, a loop have multiple facet to determine its behavior:     The facet times, to repeat a fixed number of times a set of statements:    loop times: 2 { write helloWorld; }  // the output will be helloWorld - helloWorld      The facet while, to repeat a set of statements while a condition is true:    loop while: (true) { } // infinity loop      The facet from / to, to repeat a set of statements while an index iterates over a range of values with a fixed step of 1:    loop i from:0 to: 5 { // or loop name:i from:0 to:5 -> the name is also a facet  write i; } // the output will be 0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5      The facet from / to combine with the facet step to choose the step:    loop i from:0 to: 5 step: 2 {  write i; } // the output will be 0 - 2 - 4      The facet over to browse containers, as we will see in the next part.   Nb: you can interrupt a loop at any time by using the break statement.  ## Manipulate containers  We saw in the previous parts  simple  types of variable. You also have a multiple containers types, such as list, matrix, map, pair… In this section, we will only focus on the container list (you can learn the other by reading the section about datatypes).  How to declare a list?  To declare a list, you can either or not specify the type of the data of its elements:   list<int> listOfInt <- 5,4,9,8; list listWithoutType <- 2,4.6,oij,hoh,0.0;   How to know the number of elements of a list?  To know the number of element of a list, you can use the operator length that returns the number of elements (note that this operator also works with strings).   int numberOfElements <- length(12,13); // will return 2 int numberOfElements <- length(); // will return 0 int numberOfElements <- length(stuff); // will return 5   There is an other operator, empty, that returns you a boolean telling you if the list is empty or not.   bool isEmpty <- empty(12,13); // will return false bool isEmpty <- empty(); // will return true bool isEmpty <- empty(stuff); // will return false   How to get an element from a list?  To get an element from a list by its index, you have to use the operator at (nb: it is indeed an operator, and not a facet, so no  :  after the keyword).   int theFirstElementOfTheList <- 5,4,9,8 at 0; // this will return 5 int theThirdElementOfTheList <- 5,4,9,8 at 2; // this will return 9   How to know the index of an element of a list?  You can know the index of the first occurrence of a value in a list using the operator index_of. You can know the index of the last occurrence of a value in a list using the operator last_index_of.   int result <- 4,2,3,4,5,4 last_index_of 4;  // result equals 5 int result <- 4,2,3,4,5,4 index_of 4;  // result equals 0   How to know if an element exists in a list?  You can use the operator contains (return a boolean):   bool result <- {1,2}, {3,4}, {5,6} contains {3,4};  // result equals true   How to insert/remove an element to/from a list?  For those operation, no operator are available, but you can use a statement instead. The statements add and put are used to insert/modify an element, while the statement remove is used to remove an element. Here are some example of how to use those 3 statements with the most common facets:   list<int> list_int <- 1,5,7,6,7; remove from:list_int index:1; // remove the 2nd element of the list write list_int; // the output is : 1,7,6,7 remove item:7 from:list_int; // remove the 1st occurrence of 7 write list_int; // the output is : 1,6,7 add item:9 to: list_int at: 2; // add 9 in the 3rd position write list_int; // the output is : 1,6,9,7 add 0 to: list_int; // add 0 in the last position write list_int; // the output is : 1,6,9,7,0 put 3 in: list_int at: 0; // put 3 in the 1st position write list_int; // the output is : 3,6,9,7,0 put 2 in: list_int key: 2; // put 2 in the 3rd position write list_int; // the output is : 3,6,2,7,0   How to add 2 lists?  You can add 2 lists by creating a third one and browsing the 2 first one, but you can do it much easily by using the operator + :   list<int> list_int1 <- 1,5,7,6,7; list<int> list_int2 <- 6,9; list<int> list_int_result <- list_int1 + list_int2;   How to browse a list?  You can use the facet over of a loop:   list<int> exampleOfList <- 4,2,3,4,5,4; loop i over:exampleOfList {  write i; } // the output will be 4 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 4   How to filter a list?  If you want to get all the elements of a list that fulfill a particular condition, you need the operator where. In the condition, you can design all the element of a particular list by using the pseudo variable each as followed:   list<int> exampleOfList <- 4,2,3,4,5,4 where (each <= 3);  // the list is now 2,3   Other useful operators for the manipulation of lists:  Here are some other operators which can be useful to manipulate lists: sort, sort_by, shuffle, reverse, collect, accumulate, among. Please read the GAML Reference if you want to know more about those operators.  ## Random values  When you will implement your model, you will have to manipulate some random values quite often.  To get a random value in a range of value, use the operator rnd. You can use this operator in many ways:   int var0 <- rnd (2);    // var0 equals 0, 1 or 2 float var1 <- rnd (1000) / 1000;    // var1 equals a float between 0 and 1 with a precision of 0.001 point var2 <- rnd ({2.0, 4.0}, {2.0, 5.0, 10.0}, 1);    // var2 equals a point with x = 2.0, y equal to 2.0, 3.0 or 4.0 and z between 0.0 and 10.0 every 1.0 float var3 <- rnd (2.0, 4.0, 0.5);  // var3 equals a float number between 2.0 and 4.0 every 0.5 float var4 <- rnd(3.4);     // var4 equals a random float between 0.0 and 3.4 int var5 <- rnd (2, 12, 4);     // var5 equals 2, 6 or 10 point var6 <- rnd ({2.5,3, 0.0});   // var6 equals {x,y} with x in 0.0,2.0, y in 0.0,3.0, z = 0.0 int var7 <- rnd (2, 4);     // var7 equals 2, 3 or 4 point var8 <- rnd ({2.0, 4.0}, {2.0, 5.0, 10.0});   // var8 equals a point with x = 2.0, y between 2.0 and 4.0 and z between 0.0 and 10.0 float var9 <- rnd (2.0, 4.0);   // var9 equals a float number between 2.0 and 4.0   Use the operator flip if you want to pick a boolean value with a certain probability:   bool result <- flip(0.2); // result will have 20% of chance to be true   You can use randomness in list, by using the operator shuffle, or also by using the operator among to pick randomly one (or several) element of your list:   list TwoRandomValuesFromTheList <- 2 among 5,4,9,8; // the list will be for example 5,9.   You can use probabilistic laws, using operators such as gauss, poisson, binomial, or truncated_gauss (we invite you to read the documentation for those operators).       //: # (endConcept       programming_basis)   ","url":"wiki/BasicProgrammingConceptsInGAML.md"},{"id":"wiki/ModelOrganization.md","title":" Organization of a model","content":"# Organization of a model  As already extensively detailed in the introduction page, defining a model in GAML amounts to defining a model species, which later allows to instantiate a model agent (aka a simulation), which may or may not contain micro-species, and which can be flanked by experiment plans in order to be simulated.  This conceptual structure is respected in the definition of model files, which follows a similar pattern:     Definition of the global species, preceded by a header, in order to represent the model species   Definition of the different micro-species (either nested inside the global species or at the same level)   Definition of the different experiment plans that target this model   Table of contents     Model Header (model species)   Species declarations   Experiment declarations   Basic skeleton of a model   ## Model Header (model species)  The header of a model file begins with the declaration of the name of the model. Contrarily to other statements, this declaration does not end with a semi-colon.  model name_of_the_model  The name of the model is not necessarily the same as the name of the file. It must conform to the general rule for naming species, i.e. be a valid identifier (beginning with a letter, containing only letters, digits and dashes). This name will be used for building the name of the model species, from which simulations will be instantiated. For instance, the following declaration:  model dummy  will internally create a species called dummy_model, child of the abstract species model, from which simulations (called dummy_model0, dummy_model1, etc.) will be instantiated.  This declaration is followed by optional import statements that indicate which other models this model is importing. Import statements do not end with a semi-colon.  Importing a model can take two forms. The first one, called inheritance import, is declared as follows:  import relative_path_to_a_model_file import relative_path_to_another_model_file  The second one, called usage import, is declared as follows:  import relative_path_to_a_model_file as model_identifier  When importing models using the first form, all the declarations of the model(s) imported will be merged with those of the current model (in the order with which the import statements are declared, i.e. the latest definitions of global attributes or behaviors superseding the previous ones). The second form is reserved for using models as micro-models of the current model. This possibility is still experimental in the current version of GAMA.  The last part of the header is the definition of the global species, which is the actual definition of the model species itself.  global {     // Definition of global attributes(GlobalSpecies#declaration), actions and behaviors(DefiningActionsAndBehaviors) }   Note that neither the imports nor the definition of global are mandatory. Only the model statement is.  Species declarations  The header is followed by the declaration of the different species of agents that populate the model.  The special species global is the world species. You will declare here all the global attributes/actions/behaviors. The global species does not have name, and is unique in your model.  global {     // definition of global attributes, actions, behaviors }  Regular species can be declared with the keyword species. You can declare several regular species, and they all have to be named.  species nameOfSpecies {  // definition of your species attributes(RegularSpecies#declaration), actions and behaviors(DefiningActionsAndBehaviors) }  Note that the possibility to define the species after the global definition is actually a convenience: these species are micro-species of the model species and, hence, could be perfectly defined as nested species of global. For instance:     global {     // definition of global attributes, actions, behaviors }  species A {…}  species B {…}  is completely equivalent to:  global {     // definition of global attributes, actions, behaviors  species A {...}  species B {...} }       Experiment declarations  Experiments are usually declared at the end of the file. They start with the keyword experiment. They contains the simulation parameters, and the definition of the output (such as displays, monitors or inspectors). You can declare as much experiments as you want.      experiment first_experiment {     // definition of parameters (intputs)  // definition of output output {...} }   experiment second_experiment {     // definition of parameters (inputs)  // definition of output }       Note that you have two types of experiments: A GUI experiment allows to display a graphical interface with input parameters and outputs. It is declared with the following structure :  experiment gui_experiment type:gui {  ... }  A Batch experiment allows to execute numerous successive simulation runs (often used for model exploration). It is declared with the following structure :  experiment batch_experiment type:batch {  ... }   Basic skeleton of a model  Here is the basic skeleton of a model :     model name_of_the_model  global {  // definition of global attributes, actions, behaviours }  species my_specie {  // definition of attributes, actions, behaviours }  experiment my_experiment /* + specify the type :  type:gui  or  type:batch  */ {  // here the definition of your experiment, with…  // … your inputs  output {   // … and your outputs  } }     Don t forget this structure ! This will be the basis for all the models you will create from now.       //: # (endConcept       model_structure)   ","url":"wiki/ModelOrganization.md"},{"id":"wiki/GridSpecies.md","title":" Grid Species","content":"# Grid Species //: # (keyword|concept_topology)  A grid is a particular species of agents. Indeed, a grid is a set of agents that share a grid topology (until now, we only saw species with continuous topology). As other agents, a grid species can have attributes, attributes, behaviors, aspects However, contrary to regular species, grid agents are created automatically at the beginning of the simulation. It is thus not necessary to use the create statement to create them. Moreover, in addition to classic built-in variables, grid a provided with a set of additional built-in variables.  Index     Declaration   Built-in attributes   Access to cells   Display grid   Grid with matrix   Example   Declaration  Instead of using the species keyword, use the keyword grid to declare a grid species. The grid species has exactly the same facets of the regular species, plus some others. To declare a grid, you have to specify the number of columns and rows first. You can do it two different ways:  Using the two facets width: and height: to fix the number of cells (the size of each cells will be determined thanks to the environment dimension).   grid my_grid width:8 height:10 { // my_grid has 8 columns and 10 rows }   Using the two facets cell_width: and cell_height: to fix the size of each cells (the number cells will be determined thanks to the environment dimension).   grid my_grid cell_width:3 cell_height:2 { // my_grid has cells with dimension 3m width by 2m height }   By default, a grid is composed by 100 rows and 100 columns.  Another facet exists for grid only, very useful. It is the neighbors facet, used to determine how many neighbors has each cell. You can choose among 3 values: 4 (Von Neumann), 6 (hexagon) or 8 (Moore).    A grid can also be provided with specific facets that allows to optimize the computation time and the memory space, such as use_regular_agents, use_indivitual_shapes and use_neighbours_cache. Please refer to the GAML Reference for more explanation about those particular facets.  Built-in attributes  grid_x This variable stores the column index of a cell.     grid cell width: 10 height: 10 neighbors: 4 {  init {    write my column index is: + grid_x;  }    }   grid_y This variable stores the row index of a cell.     grid cell width: 10 height: 10 neighbors: 4 {  init {    write my row index is: + grid_y;  }    }  ### agents  return the set of agents located inside the cell. Note the use of this variable is deprecated. It is preferable to use the inside operator: //: # (keyword|operator_inside)    grid cell width: 10 height: 10 neighbors: 4 {   list<bug> bugs_inside -> {bug inside self};    }   ### color The color built-in variable is used by the optimized grid display. Indeed, it is possible to use for grid agents an optimized aspect by using in a display the grid keyword. In this case, the grid will be displayed using the color defined by the color variable. The border of the cells can be displayed with a specific color by using the lines facet.  Here an example of the display of a grid species named cell with black border.   experiment main_xp type: gui{  output {   display map {    grid cell lines: rgb(black) ;   }  } }   ### neighbors The neighbors built-in variable returns the list of cells at a distance of 1.   grid my_grid {   reflex writeNeighbors {     write neighbors;   } }   grid_value The grid_value built-in variable is used when initializing a grid from grid file (see later). It is also used for the 3D representation of DEM.  Access to a cell  there are several ways to access to a specific cell:     by a location: by casting a location to a cell (the unity (#m, #cm, etc…) is defined when you choose your environment size, in the global species.          global {   init {    write  cell at {57.5, 45} :  + cell({57.5, 45});   }    }  grid cell width: 10 height: 10 neighbors: 4 {    }         by the row and column indexes: like matrix, it is possible to directly access to a cell from its indexes       global {   init {    write cell 5,8 : + cell5,8;   }    }    grid cell width: 10 height: 10 neighbors: 4 {    }   The operator grid_at also exists to get a particular cell. You just have to specify the index of the cell you want (in x and y):      global {   init {    agent cellAgent <- cell grid_at {5,8};    write cell 5,8 : + cellAgent;   }    }    grid cell width: 10 height: 10 neighbors: 4 {    }   Display Grid  You can easily display your grid in your experiment as followed :   experiment MyExperiment type: gui {     output {  display MyDisplay type: opengl {   grid MyGrid;  }     } }   The grid will be displayed, using the color you defined for each cell (with the  color  built-in attribute). You can also show border of each cell by using the facet  line:  and choosing a rgb color:   grid MyGrid line:#black;   An other way to display a grid will be to define an aspect in your grid agent (the same way as for a regular species), and define your grid as a regular species then in your experiment, choosing your aspect :      grid MyGrid {     aspect firstAspect {  draw square(1);     }     aspect secondAspect {  draw circle(1);     } }  experiment MyExperiment type: gui {     output {  display MyDisplay type: opengl {   species MyGrid aspect:firstAspect;  }     } }      Beware : don t use this second display when you have large grids : it s much slower.  ## Grid from a matrix  An easy way to load some values in a grid is to use matrix data. A matrix is a type of container (we invite you to learn some more about this useful type here). Once you have declared your matrix, you can set the values of your cells using the ask statement :   global {   init {     matrix data <- matrix(0,1,1,1,2,0);     ask cell {       grid_value <- float(datagrid_x, grid_y);     }    } }   Declaring larger matrix in GAML can be boring as you can imagine. You can load your matrix directly from a csv file with the operator matrix (used for the contruction of the matrix).   file my_file <- csv_file(path/file.csv,separator); matrix my_matrix <- matrix(my_file);   You can try to read the following csv :  0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0 0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0 0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0 0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0 0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0   With the following model :      model import_csv  global {   file my_csv_file <- csv_file( ../includes/test.csv , , );   init {     matrix data <- matrix(my_csv_file);     ask my_gama_grid {       grid_value <- float(datagrid_x,grid_y);       write datagrid_x,grid_y;     }   } }  grid my_gama_grid width: 11 height: 8 {   reflex update_color {     write grid_value;     color <- (grid_value = 1) ? #blue : #white;   } }  experiment main type: gui{   output {     display display_grid {       grid my_gama_grid;     }   } }      For more complicated models, you can read some other files, such as ASCII files (asc), DEM files…       //: # (endConcept       grid) Example  To practice a bit those notions, we will build a quick model. A  regular  species will move randomly on the environment. A grid is displayed, and its cells becomes red when an instance of the regular species is waking inside this cell, and yellow when the regular agent is in the surrounding of this cell. If no regular agent is on the surrounding, the cell turns green.    Here is an example of implementation:      model my_grid_model  global{  float max_range <- 5.0;  int number_of_agents <- 5;  init {   create my_species number:number_of_agents;  }  reflex update {   ask my_species {    do wander amplitude:180;     ask my_grid at_distance(max_range)    {     if(self overlaps myself)     {      self.color_value <- 2;     }     else if (self.color_value != 2)     {      self.color_value <- 1;     }    }   }   ask my_grid {    do update_color;   }   } }  species my_species skills:moving {  float speed <- 2.0;  aspect default {   draw circle(1) color:#blue;  } }  grid my_grid width:30 height:30 {  int color_value <- 0;  action update_color {   if (color_value = 0) {    color <- #green;   }   else if (color_value = 1) {    color <- #yellow;   }   else if (color_value = 2) {    color <- #red;   }   color_value <- 0;  } }  experiment MyExperiment type: gui {     output {  display MyDisplay type: java2D {   grid my_grid lines:#black;   species my_species aspect:default;   }     } }     ","url":"wiki/GridSpecies.md"},{"id":"wiki/MultiLevelArchitecture.md","title":" Multi-level architecture","content":"# Multi-level architecture  The multi-level architecture offers the modeler the following possibilities: the declaration of a species as a micro-species of another species, the representation of an entity as different types of agent (i.e., GAML species), the dynamic migration of agents between populations.  Index     Declaration of micro-species   Access to micro-agents / host agent   Representation of an entity as different types of agent   Dynamic migration of agents   Example   Declaration of micro-species  A species can have other species as micro-species. The micro-species of a species is declared inside the species  declaration.   species macro_species {       species micro_species_in_group {       } }   In the above example,  micro_species_in_group  is a micro-species of  macro_species . An agent of  macro_species  can have agents  micro_species_in_group  as micro-agents. Agents of  micro_species_in_group  have an agent of  macro_species  as  host  agent.  As the species  micro_species_in_group  is declared inside the species  macro_species ,  micro_species_in_group  will return a list of  micro_species_in_group  agent inside the given  macro_species  agent.      global {  init {   create macro_species number:5;  } }  species macro_species  {   init {   create micro_species_in_group number:rnd(10);   write  the macro species named  +name+  contains  +length(micro_species_in_group)+  micro-species. ;  }  species micro_species_in_group { } }   experiment my_experiment type: gui { }      In this above example, we create 5 macro-species, and each one of these macro-species create a random number of inner micro-species. We can see that  micro_species_in_group  refers to the list of micro-species inside the given macro-species.  Access to micro-agents, host agent  To access to micro-agents (from a macro-agent), and to host agent (from a micro-agents), you have to use two built-in attributes.  The members built-in attribute is used inside the macro-agent, to get the list of all its micro-agents.      species macro_species  {  init {   create first_micro_species number:3;   create second_micro_species number:6;   write  the macro species named  +name+  contains  +length(members)+  micro-species. ;  }  species first_micro_species { }  species second_micro_species { } }       The host built-in attribute is used inside the micro-agent to get the host macro-agent.      species macro_species {  micro_species_in_group micro_agent;  init {  create micro_species_in_group number:rnd(10);  write the macro species named +name+ contains +length(members)+ micro-species.; }  species micro_species_in_group {  init {   write the micro species named +name+ is hosted by +host;  } } }       NB: We already said that the world agent is a particular agent, instantiated just once. In fact, the world agent is the host of all the agents. You can try to get the host for a regular species, you will get the world agent itself (named as you named your model). You can also try to get the members of your world (from the global scope for example), and you will get the list of the agents presents in the world.      global {  init {   create macro_species number:5;   write  the world has  +length(members)+  members. ;  } }  species macro_species  {   init {   write  the macro species named  +name+  is hosted by  +host;  } }      Representation of an entity as different types of agent  The multi-level architecture is often used in order to represent an entity through different types of agent. For example, an agent  bee  can have a behavior when it is alone, but when the agent is near from a lot of agents, he can changes his type to  bee_in_swarm , defined as a micro-species of a macro-species  swarm . Other example: an agent  pedestrian  can have a certain behavior when walking on the street, and then change his type to  pedestrian_in_building  when he is in a macro-species  building . You have then to distinguish two different species to define your micro-species: - The first can be seen as a regular species (it is the  bee  or the  pedestrian  for instance). We will name this species as  micro_species . - The second is the real micro-species, defined inside the macro-species (it is the  bee_in_swarm  or the  pedestrian_in_building  for instance). We will name this species as  micro_species_in_group . This species has to inherit from the  micro_species .      species micro_species { }  species macro_species  {   species micro_species_in_group parent: micro_species {  } }      Dynamic migration of agents  In our example about bees, a  swarm  entity is composed of nearby flying  bee  entities. When a  bee  entity approaches a  swarm  entity, this  bee  entity will become a member of the group. To represent this, the modeler lets the  bee  agent change its species to  bee_in_swarm  species. The  bee  agent hence becomes a  bee_in_swarm  agent. To change species of agent, we can use one of the following statements: capture, release, migrate.  The statement capture is used by the  macro_species  to capture one (or several)  micro_species  agent(s), and turn it (them) to a  micro_species_in_group . You can specify which agent (or list of agents) you want to capture by using the facet target. The facet as is used to cast the agent from  micro_species  to  micro_species_in_group . You can use the facet return to get the newly captured agent(s).   capture target:micro_species as:micro_species_in_group;   The statement release is used by the  macro_species  to release one (or several)  micro_species_in_group  agent(s), and turn it (them) to a  micro_species . You can specify which agent (or list of agents) you want to release by using the facet target. The facet as is used to cast the agent from  micro_species_in_group  to  micro_species . The facet in is used to specify the new host (by default, it is the host of the  macro_species ). You can use the facet return to get the newly released agent(s).   release target:list(micro_species_in_group) as:micro_species in:world;   The statement migrate, less used, permits agents to migrate from one population/species to another population/species and stay in the same host after the migration. Read the GAML Reference to learn more about this statement. //: # (endConcept|multi_level)  Example:  Here is an example of micro_species that gather together in macro_species when they are close enough.        model multilevel  global {  int release_time <- 20;  int capture_time <- 100;  int remaining_release_time <- 0;  int remaining_capture_time <- capture_time;  init {   create micro_species number:200;  }  reflex reflex_timer {   if (remaining_release_time=1)   {    remaining_release_time <- 0;    remaining_capture_time <- capture_time;   }   else if (remaining_capture_time=1)   {    remaining_capture_time <- 0;    remaining_release_time <- release_time;   }   remaining_release_time <- remaining_release_time - 1;   remaining_capture_time <- remaining_capture_time - 1;  }  reflex capture_micro_species when:(remaining_capture_time>0 and flip(0.1)) {   ask macro_species {    list micro_species_in_range <- micro_species at_distance 1;    if (micro_species_in_range != ) {     do capture_micro_species(micro_species_in_range);    }   }   ask micro_species {    list micro_species_list_to_be_captured <- micro_species at_distance 1;    if(micro_species_list_to_be_captured != ) {     create macro_species {      location <- myself.location;      add item:myself to:micro_species_list_to_be_captured;      do capture_micro_species(micro_species_list_to_be_captured);     }    }   }  } }  species micro_species skills:moving {  geometry shape <- circle(1);  aspect base {   draw shape;  }  reflex move{   do wander;  } }  species macro_species {  geometry shape <- circle(1) update:circle(length(members));  species micro_species_in_group parent:micro_species { }  action capture_micro_species(list<micro_species> micro_list) {  loop mic_sp over:micro_list {   capture mic_sp as:micro_species_in_group;  } }  reflex release_reflex when:(remaining_release_time>0 and flip(0.1)) {  release members as:micro_species /*in:world*/;  do die; }  aspect base {  draw shape;  draw text:string(length(members)) color:#black size:4; } }   experiment MyExperiment type: gui {  output {   display MyDisplay type: java2D {    species macro_species aspect: base;    species micro_species aspect: base;   }  } }     ","url":"wiki/MultiLevelArchitecture.md"},{"id":"wiki/MirrorSpecies.md","title":" Mirror species","content":"# Mirror species  A mirror species is a species whose population is automatically managed with respect to another species.

First the graph species must inherit from the abstract species graph_node, then the method related_to must be redefined and finally an auxiliary species that inherits from base_edge used to represent the edges of the generated graph must be declared. A graph node is an abstract species that must redefine one method called related_to.      species graph_agent parent: graph_node edge_species: edge_agent{   bool related_to(graph_agent other){    return true;   } }  species edge_agent parent: base_edge { }      The method related_to returns a boolean, and take the agents from the current species in argument.

Beware: The topology used in graph species is the graph topology, and not the continuous topology. You can force the use of the continuous topology with the action using as follow:   bool related_to(graph_agent other){    using topology:topology(world) {     return (self.location distance_to other.location < 20);    } }     The abstract mother species  graph_node  has an attribute  my_graph , with the type  graph . The graph type represent a graph composed of vertices linked with edges. This type has built-in attributes such as edges (the list of all the edges agents), or vertices (the list of all the vertices agents).  Declare a graph by using an geometry file  In most cases, you will have to construct a graph from an existing file (example: a  shp  file). In that case, you will have to first instantiate a species from the shape file (with the create statement, using the facet from). When, you will have to extract a graph from the agent, using the operator as_edge_graph.      model load_shape_file  global {  file roads_shapefile <- file( ../includes/road.shp );  geometry shape <- envelope(roads_shapefile);  graph road_network;  init {  create road from: roads_shapefile;  road_network <- as_edge_graph(road); } }   species road {  aspect geom {   draw shape color: #black;  } }  experiment main_experiment type:gui{  output {   display map {    species road aspect:geom;     }  } }      Declare a graph with nodes and edges  Another way to create a graph is building it manually nodes by nodes, and then edges by edges, without using agent structures. Use the add_node operator and the add_edge operator to do so. Here is an example of how to do:      add point(0.0,0.0) to:nodes; add point(90.0,90.0) to:nodes; add point(20.0,20.0) to:nodes; add point(40.0,50.0) to:nodes; add point(100.0,0.0) to:nodes;  loop nod over:nodes {  my_graph <- my_graph add_node(nod); }  my_graph <- my_graph add_edge (nodes at 0::nodes at 2); my_graph <- my_graph add_edge (nodes at 2::nodes at 3); my_graph <- my_graph add_edge (nodes at 3::nodes at 1); my_graph <- my_graph add_edge (nodes at 0::nodes at 4); my_graph <- my_graph add_edge (nodes at 4::nodes at 1);      Using this solution, my_graph can have two types: it can be an a-spatial graph, or a spatial graph. The spatial graph will have a proper geometry, with segments that follow the position of your graph (you can access to the segments by using the built-in  segments ).

To use it, you have to specify a graph (on the left side of the operator), and a node (on the right side of the operator).  The following code (to put inside the node species) displays the number of edges attached to each node:   aspect base {  draw text:string(my_graph degree_of node(5)) color:# black;  status <- 0; }   Get the neighbors of a node  To get the list of neighbors of a node, you should use the neighbors_of operator. On the left side of the operator, specify the graph you are using, and on the right side, specify the node. The operator returns the list of nodes located at a distance inferior or equal to 1, considering the graph topology.   species graph_agent parent: graph_node edge_species: edge_agent {   list<graph_agent> list_neighbors <- list<graph_agent>(my_graph neighbors_of (self)); }   Here is an example of model using those two previous concepts (a random node is chosen each step, displayed in red, and his neighbors are displayed in yellow):        model graph_model  global {  int number_of_agents <- 50;  init  {   create graph_agent number: number_of_agents;  }  reflex update {  ask graph_agent(one_of(graph_agent)) {   status <- 2;   do update_neighbors;  } } }   species graph_agent parent: graph_node edge_species: edge_agent {  int status <- 0;  list list_connected_index;  init {  int i<-0;  loop over:graph_agent {   if (flip(0.1)) {    add i to:list_connected_index;   }   i <- i+1;  } }  bool related_to(graph_agent other){    if (list_connected_index contains (graph_agent index_of other)) {     return true;    }    return false; }  action update_neighbors {   list<graph_agent> list_neighbors <- list<graph_agent>(my_graph neighbors_of (self));   loop neighb over:list_neighbors {   neighb.status <- 1;  } }  aspect base {  if (status = 0) {   draw circle(2) color: # green;  }  else if (status = 1) {   draw circle(2) color: # yellow;  }  else if (status = 2) {   draw circle(2) color: # red;  }  draw text:string(my_graph degree_of self) color:# black size:4 at:point(self.location.x-1,self.location.y-2);  status <- 0; } }   species edge_agent parent: base_edge {  aspect base  {   draw shape color: # blue;  } }  experiment MyExperiment type: gui {  output  {   display MyDisplay type: java2D   {    species graph_agent aspect: base;    species edge_agent aspect: base;   }  } }      Compute the shortest path  To compute the shortest path to go from a point to another, pick a source and a destination among the vertices you have for your graph. Store those values as point type.   point source; point destination; source <- point(one_of(my_graph.vertices)); destination <- point(one_of(my_graph.vertices));   Then, you can use the operator path_between to return the shortest path. To use this action, you have to give the graph, then the source point, and the destination point. This action returns a path type.   path shortest_path; shortest_path <- path_between (my_graph, source,destination);   Another operator exists, paths_between, that returns a list of shortest paths between two points. Please read the documentation to learn more about this operator.  Here is an example of code that show the shortest path between two points of a graph:        model graph_model  global {  int number_of_agents <- 50;  point source;  point target;  graph my_graph;  path shortest_path;  init {  create graph_agent number: number_of_agents; }  reflex pick_two_points {  if (my_graph=nil) {   ask graph_agent {    myself.my_graph <- self.my_graph;    break;   }  }  shortest_path <- nil;  loop while:shortest_path=nil {   source <- point(one_of(my_graph.vertices));   target <- point(one_of(my_graph.vertices));   if (source != target) {    shortest_path <- path_between (my_graph, source,target);   }  } } }   species graph_agent parent: graph_node edge_species: edge_agent {  list list_connected_index;  init {  int i<-0;  loop over:graph_agent {   if (flip(0.1)) {    add i to:list_connected_index;   }   i <- i+1;  } }  bool related_to(graph_agent other) {    using topology:topology(world) {      return (self.location distance_to other.location < 20);     } }  aspect base {  draw circle(2) color: # green; } }   species edge_agent parent: base_edge {  aspect base {   draw shape color: # blue;  } }  experiment MyExperiment type: gui {  output {   display MyDisplay type: java2D {    species graph_agent aspect: base;    species edge_agent aspect: base;    graphics  shortest path  {     if (shortest_path != nil) {      draw circle(3) at: source color: #yellow;      draw circle(3) at: target color: #cyan;      draw (shortest_path.shape+1) color: #magenta;     }    }   }  } }      Control the weight in graph  You can add a map of weight for the edges that compose the graph. Use the operator with_weights to put weights in your graph. The graph has to be on the left side of the operator, and the map has to be on the right side. In the map, you have to put edges as key, and the weight for that edge as value. One common use is to put the distance as weight:   my_graph <- my_graph with_weights (my_graph.edges as_map (each::geometry(each).perimeter));   The calculation of shortest path can change according to the weight you choose for your edges. For example, here is the result of the calculation of the shortest path when all the edges have 1 as weight value (it is the default graph topology), and when the edges have their length as weight.    Here is an example of implementation:      model shortest_path_with_weight  global {  graph my_graph<-spatial_graph();  path shortest_path;  list nodes;  init {  add point(10.0,10.0) to:nodes;  add point(90.0,90.0) to:nodes;  add point(40.0,20.0) to:nodes;  add point(80.0,50.0) to:nodes;  add point(90.0,20.0) to:nodes;   loop nod over:nodes {   my_graph <- my_graph add_node(nod);  }    my_graph <- my_graph add_edge (nodes at 0::nodes at 2);  my_graph <- my_graph add_edge (nodes at 2::nodes at 3);  my_graph <- my_graph add_edge (nodes at 3::nodes at 1);  my_graph <- my_graph add_edge (nodes at 0::nodes at 4);  my_graph <- my_graph add_edge (nodes at 4::nodes at 1);    // comment/decomment the following line to see the difference.  my_graph <- my_graph with_weights (my_graph.edges as_map (each::geometry(each).perimeter));    shortest_path <- path_between(my_graph,nodes at 0, nodes at 1); } }   experiment MyExperiment type: gui {  output {   display MyDisplay type: java2D {    graphics  shortest path  {     if (shortest_path != nil) {      draw circle(3) at: point(shortest_path.source) color: #yellow;      draw circle(3) at: point(shortest_path.target) color: #cyan;      draw (shortest_path.shape+1) color: #magenta;     }     loop edges over: my_graph.edges {      draw edges color: #black;     }    }   }  } }     //: # (endConcept|graph) ","url":"wiki/GraphSpecies.md"},{"id":"wiki/DefiningCharts.md","title":" Defining Charts","content":"# Defining Charts  To visualize result and make analysis about you model, you will certainly have to use charts.

The basic camera properties are its position, the direction in which is pointing, and its orientation. Those 3 parameters can be set dynamically at each iteration of the simulation.  Camera position The facet camera_pos(x,y,z) places the camera at the given position. The default camera positon is (world.width/2,world/height/2,world.maxDim*1.5) to place the camera at the middle of the environement at an altitude that enables to see the entire environment.  Camera direction (Look Position) The facet camera_look_pos(x,y,z) points the camera toward the given position.  The default look position is (world.width/2,world/height/2,0) to look at the center of the environment.  Camera orientation (Up Vector) The camera camera_up_vector(x,y,z) sets the up vector of the camera. The up vector direction in your scene is the up direction on your display screen. The default value is (0,1,0)  Here are some examples that can be done using those 3 parameters.

The way how light sources and 3D object interact is called lighting. Lighting is an important factor to render realistic scenes.  In a real world, the color that we see depend on the interaction between color material surfaces, the light sources and the position of the viewer. There are four kinds of lighting called ambient, diffuse, specular and emissive.  Gama handle ambient and diffuse light.     ambient_light: Allows to define the value of the ambient light either using an int (ambient_light:(125)) or a rgb color ((ambient_light:rgb(255,255,255)). default is rgb(125,125,125).   diffuse_light: Allows to define the value of the diffuse light either using an int (diffuse_light:(125)) or a rgb color ((diffuse_light:rgb(255,255,255)). default is rgb(125,125,125).   diffuse_light_pos: Allows to define the position of the diffuse light either using an point (diffuse_light_pos:{x,y,z}). default is {world.shape.width/2,world.shape.height/2,world.shape.width*2}.   is_light_on: Allows to enable/disable the light.

You can define several displays related with what you want to represent from your model execution. To define a display, use the keyword display inside the output scope, and specify a name (name facet).   experiment my_experiment type: gui {  output {   display display1 {   }   display name:display2 {   }  } }   Other facets are available when defining your display: * Use background to define a color for your background  display my_display background:#red  //: # (keyword|concept_refresh) * Use refresh if you want to refresh the display when a condition is true (to refresh your display every number of steps, use the operator every)  display my_display refresh:every(10)   You can choose between two types of displays, by using the facet type: * java2D displays will be used when you want to have 2D visualization. It is used for example when you manipulate charts. This is the default value for the facet type.  * opengl displays allows you to have 3D visualization.  You can save the display on the disk, as a png file, in the folder name_of_model/models/snapshots, by using the facet autosave. This facet takes one a boolean as argument (to allow or not to save each frame) or a point (to define the size of your image). By default, the resolution of the output image is 500x500px (note that when no unit is provided, the unit is #px (pixel) ).   display my_display autosave:true type:java2D {}   is equivalent to :   display my_display autosave:{500,500} type:java2D {}   Each display can be decomposed in one or several layers. Here is a screenshot (from the Toy Model Ant) to better understand those different notions we are about to tackle in this session.    Organize your layers  In one 2D display, you will have several types of layers, giving what you want to display in your model. You have a large number of layers available. You already know some of them, such as species, agents, grid, but other specific layers such as image (to display image) and graphics (to freely draw shapes/geometries/texts without having to define a species) are also available  Each layer will be displayed in the same order as you declare them. The last declared layer will be above the others.  Thus, the following code:   experiment expe type:gui {     output {  display my_display {   graphics layer1 {       draw square(20) at:{10,10} color:#gold;   }   graphics layer2 {       draw square(20) at:{15,15} color:#darkorange;   }   graphics layer3 {       draw square(20) at:{20,20} color:#cornflowerblue;   }  }     } }   Will have this output:    Most of the layers have the transparency facet in order to see the layers which are under.   experiment expe type:gui {  output {   display my_display {    graphics layer1 {     draw square(20) at:{10,10} color:#darkorange;    }    graphics layer2 transparency:0.5 {     draw square(20) at:{15,15} color:#cornflowerblue;    }   }  } }     To specify a position and a size for your layer, you can use the position and the size facets. The position facet is used with a point type, between {0,0} and {1,1}, which corresponds to the position of the upper left corner of your layer in percentage. Then, if you choose the point {0.5,0.5}, the upper left corner of your layer will be in the center of your display. By default, this value is {0,0}. The size facet is used with a point type, between {0,0} and {1,1} also. It corresponds to the size occupied by the layer in percentage. By default, this value is {1,1}.   experiment expe type:gui {  output {   display my_display {    graphics layer1 position:{0,0} size:{0.5,0.8} {     draw shape color:#darkorange;    }    graphics layer2 position:{0.3,0.1} size:{0.6,0.2} {     draw shape color:#cornflowerblue;    }    graphics layer3 position:{0.4,0.2} size:{0.3,0.8} {     draw shape color:#gold;    }   }  } }     NB : displays can have background, while graphics can t. If you want to put a background for your graphics, a solution can be to draw the shape of the world (which is, by default, a square 100m*100m).  A lot of other facets are available for the different layers. Please read the documentation of graphics for more information.  Example of layers  agents layer agents allows the modeler to display only the agents that fulfill a given condition.  Please read the documentation about agents statement if you are interested.  species layer species allows modeler to display all the agent of a given species in the current display. In particular, modeler can choose the aspect used to display them.  Please read the documentation about species statement if you are interested.  image layer image allows modeler to display an image (e.g. as background of a simulation).  Please read the documentation about image statement if you are interested.  ### graphics layer graphics allows the modeler to freely draw shapes/geometries/texts without having to define a species.

Index     Catch Mouse Event   Define User command  … in the GUI Experiment scope       … in global or regular species       user_location       user_input User Control Architecture   Catch Mouse Event  You can catch mouse event during the simulation using the statement event. This statement has 2 required facets: * name (identifier) : Specify which event do you want to trigger (among the following values : mouse_down, mouse_up, mouse_move, mouse_enter, mouse_exit or any alphanumeric symbol/key of the keyboard, such as,  a ,  b …). * action (identifier) : Specify the name of the global action to call.   event mouse_down action: my_action;   The event statement has to be defined in the experiment/output/display scope. Once the event is triggered, the global action linked will be called. The action linked cannot have arguments. To get the location of the mouse click, the #user_location can be used; to get the agents on which the mouse has clicked, you can use spatial query (e.g. my_species overlapping #user_location).      global {  action my_action  {   write  do action ;  }  }  species my_species { }  experiment my_experiment type: gui {  output  {   display my_display   {    species my_species;    event mouse_down action: my_action;   }  } }      Define User command  Anywhere in the global block, in a species or in an (GUI) experiment, user_command statements can be implemented. They can either call directly an existing action (with or without arguments) or be followed by a block that describes what to do when this command is run.  Their syntax can be (depending of the modeler needs) either:   user_command cmd_name action: action_without_arg_name; //or user_command cmd_name action: action_name with: arg1::val1, arg2::val2; //or user_command cmd_name {    // statements }   For instance:   user_command kill_myself action: die; //or user_command kill_myself action: some_action with: arg1::5, arg2::3; //or user_command kill_myself {     do die; }   Defining User command in GUI Experiment scope  The user command can be defined directly inside the GUI experiment scope. In that case, the implemented action appears as a button in the top of the parameter view.

Here is a quick example of model :      model quick_user_command_model  global {  init {   create my_species number:10;  } }  species my_species {  user_command cmd_inside_experiment action:die;  aspect base {   draw circle(1) color:#blue;  } }  experiment expe type:gui {  output {   display my_display {    species my_species aspect:base;   }  } }      During the execution, you have 2 ways to access to the action : * When the agent is inspected, they appear as buttons above the agents  attributes   * When the agent is selected by a right-click in a display, these command appear under the usual  Inspect ,  Focus  and  Highlight  commands in the pop-up menu.    Remark: The execution of a command obeys the following rules: * when the command is called from right-click pop-menu, it is executed immediately * when the command is called from panels, its execution is postponed until the end of the current step and then executed at that time.  user_location  In the special case when the user_command is called from the pop-up menu (from a right-click on an agent in a display), the location chosen by the user (translated into the model coordinates) is passed to the execution scope under the name user_location.  Example:   global {    user_command Create agents here {       create my_species number: 10 with: location::user_location;    } }   This will allow the user to click on a display, choose the world (always present now), and select the menu item  Create agents here .  Note that if the world is inspected (this user_command appears thus as a button) and the user chooses to push the button, the agent will be created at a random location.  user_input  As it is also, sometimes, necessary to ask the user for some values (not defined as parameters), the user_input unary operator has been introduced. This operator takes a map string::value as argument (the key is the name of the chosen parameter, the value is the default value), displays a dialog asking the user for these values, and returns the same map with the modified values (if any). You can also add a text as first argument of the operator, which will be displayed as a title for your dialog popup. The dialog is modal and will interrupt the execution of the simulation until the user has either dismissed or accepted it. It can be used, for instance, in an init section like the following one to force the user to input new values instead of relying on the initial values of parameters.  Here is an example of implementation:      model quick_user_command_model  global {    init {       map values <- user_input( choose a number of agent to create , Number  :: 100);       create my_species number : int(values at  Number );    } }  species my_species {  aspect base {   draw circle(1) color:#blue;  } }  experiment expe type:gui {  output {   display my_display {    species my_species aspect:base;   }  } }      When running this model, you will first have to input a number:    User Control Architecture  An other way to define user interaction is to use the user control architecture.

It takes its roots in object-oriented languages like Java or Smalltalk, but extends the object-oriented programming approach with powerful concepts (like skills, declarative definitions or agent migration) to allow for a better expressivity in models.  It is of course very close to agent_based modeling languages like, e.g., NetLogo, but, in addition to enriching the traditional representation of agents with modern computing notions like inheritance, type safety or multi-level agency, and providing the possibility to use different behavioral architectures for programming agents, GAML extends the agent-based paradigm to eliminate the boundaries between the domain of a model (which, in ABM, is represented with agents) and the experimental processes surrounding its simulations (which are usually not represented with agents), including, for example, visualization processes. This paper (Drogoul A., Vanbergue D., Meurisse T., Multi-Agent Based Simulation: Where are the Agents ?, Multi-Agent Based Simulation 3, pp. 1-15, LNCS, Springer-Verlag. 2003) was in particular foundational in the definition of the concepts on which GAMA (and GAML) are based today.  This orientation has several conceptual consequences among which at least two are of immediate practical interest for modelers: * Since simulations, or experiments, are represented by agents, GAMA is bound to support high-level model compositionality, i.e. the definition of models that can use other models as inner agents, leveraging multi-modeling or multi-paradigm modeling as particular cases of composition. * The visualization of models can be expressed by models of visualization, composed of agents entirely dedicated to visually represent other agents, allowing for a clear separation of concerns between a simulation and its representation and, hence, the possibility to play with multiple representations of the same model at once.  Table of contents     Key Concepts (Under construction)  Lexical semantics of GAML       Translation into a concrete syntax       Vocabulary correspondance with the object-oriented paradigm as in Java       Vocabulary correspondance with the agent-based paradigm as in NetLogo Lexical semantics of GAML The vocabulary of GAML is described in the following sentences, in which the meaning and relationships of the important words of the language (in bold face) are summarized.     The role of GAML is to support modelers in writing models, which are specifications of simulations that can be executed and controlled during experiments, themselves specified by experiment plans.   The agent-oriented modeling paradigm means that everything  active  (entities of a model, systems, processes, activities, like simulations and experiments) can be represented in GAML as an agent (which can be thought of as a computational component owning its own data and executing its own behavior, alone or in interaction with other agents).   Like in the object-oriented paradigm, where the notion of class is used to supply a specification for objects, agents in GAML are specified by their species, which provide them with a set of attributes (what they know), actions (what they can do), behaviors (what they actually do) and also specifies properties of their population, for instance its topology (how they are connected) or schedule (in which order and when they should execute).   Any species can be nested in another species (called its macro-species), in which case the populations of its instances will imperatively be hosted by an instance of this macro-species. A species can also inherit its properties from another species (called its parent species), creating a relationship similar to specialization in object-oriented design. In addition to this, species can be constructed in a compositional way with the notion of skills, bundles of attributes and actions that can be shared between different species and inherited by their children.   Given that all agents are specified by a species, simulations and experiments are then instances of two species which are, respectively, called model and experiment plan. Think of them as  specialized  categories of species.   The relationships between species, models and experiment plans are codified in the meta-model of GAML in the form of a framework composed of three abstract species respectively called agent (direct or indirect parent of all species), model (parent of all species that define a model) and experiment (parent of all species that define an experiment plan). In this meta-model, instances of the children of agent know the instance of the child of model in which they are hosted as their world, while the instance of experiment plan identifies the same agent as one of the simulations it is in charge of. The following diagram summarizes this framework:     Putting this all together, writing a model in GAML then consists in defining a species which inherits from model, in which other species, inheriting (directly or not) from agent and representing the entities that populate this model, will be nested, and which is itself nested in one or several experiment plans among which a user will be able to choose which experiment he/she wants to execute.    At the operational level, i.e. when running an experiment in GAMA,  Translation into a concrete syntax The concepts presented above are expressed in GAML using a syntax which bears resemblances with mainstream programming languages like Java, while reusing some structures from Smalltalk (namely, the syntax of facets or the infix notation of operators). While this syntax is fully described in the subsequent sections of the documentation, we summarize here the meaning of its most prominent structures and their correspondance (when it exists) with the ones used in Java and NetLogo.     A model is composed of a header, in which it can refer to other models, and a sequence of species and experiments declarations, in the form of special declarative statements of the language.   A statement can be either a declaration or a command. It is always composed of a keyword followed by an optional expression, followed by a sequence of facets, each of them composed of a keyword (terminated by a  : ) and an expression.   facets allow to pass arguments to statements. Their value is an expression of a given type. An expression can be a literary constant, the name of an attribute, variable or pseudo-variable, the name of a unit or constant of the language, or the application of an operator.   A type can be a primitive type, a species type or a parametric type (i.e. a composition of types).   Some statements can include sub-statements in a block (sequence of statements enclosed in curly brackets).   declarative statements support the definition of special constructs of the language: for instance, species (including global and experiment species), attributes, actions, behaviors, aspects, variables, parameters and outputs of experiments.   imperative statements that execute something or control the flow of execution of actions, behaviors and aspects are called commands.   A species declaration (global, species or grid keywords) can only include 6 types of declarative statements : attributes, actions, behaviors, aspects, equations and (nested) species. In addition, experiment species allow to declare parameters, outputs and batch methods.

A social norm is a set of actions executed under certain conditions which are known by the people has the right things to do in that conditions. As it is, it can be assimilated into a plan. However, a norm can be violated which mean an agent chose to disobey and do not execute it while it should. To do this, each agent has an obedient value, between 0 and 1 ad computed from its personality and each norm has a threshold. If the obedient value of the agent is above the threshold, the norm is executed. An obligation is a mental state that can be assimilated with a desire. It is created by a law that indicates under which conditions the agent has to follow a particular obligation. Once again, the law can have a threshold value to be activated or not depending on the obedient value of the agent. If an agent has an obligation, it will give up its current intention and current plan to get this obligation as its intention. Then, it will choose a specific norm to answer this obligation, once again with a threshold on the obedient value. Finally, an enforcement mechanism can be defined during the perception process. Norms, laws, and obligation can be enforced. If a violation is detected, a sanction can be executed. If the norm/law/obligation is fulfilled, a reward can be executed.  Model Definition ### law We add a law to the gold miner species that will create the obligation to get a gold if a gold nugget is perceived. This law replaces a rule and expresses the fact that miners are working or not, depending on their obedience value.     species miner skills: moving control:simple_bdi {  …  law working belief: mine_location new_obligation: has_gold     when:not has_obligation(has_gold) and not has_belief(has_gold) strength: 2.0 threshold:thresholdLaw;      ... }       norms The miners will have two norms. A first one to answer the obligation to collect gold. This norms replaces the previous plan created for this purpose. However, a new plan is declared to get 3 pieces of gold at each time. This plan will be considered illegal by the policeman species.  species miner skills: moving control:simple_bdi {  ...  norm doingJob obligation:has_gold finished_when: has_belief(has_gold) threshold:thresholdObligation{   if (target = nil) {    do add_subintention(has_gold,choose_goldmine, true);    do current_intention_on_hold();   } else {    do goto target: target ;    if (target = location)  {     goldmine current_mine<- goldmine first_with (target = each.location);     if current_mine.quantity > 0 {      gold_transported <- gold_transported+1;       do add_belief(has_gold);      ask current_mine {quantity <- quantity - 1;}      } else {      do add_belief(new_predicate(empty_mine_location, location_value::target));      do remove_belief(new_predicate(mine_at_location, location_value::target));     }     target <- nil;    }   }   } }   The second norm is a social norm to communicate the list of known mines to one s friends. It replaces the previous plan that did this action, while a new plan is added to give a wrong list of mines to one s friend.     species miner skills: moving control:simple_bdi {  …  norm share_information intention:share_information threshold:thresholdNorm instantaneous: true{   list my_friends <- list((social_link_base where (each.liking > 0)) collect each.agent);   loop known_goldmine over: get_beliefs_with_name(mine_at_location) {    ask my_friends {     do add_belief(known_goldmine);    }   }   loop known_empty_goldmine over: get_beliefs_with_name(empty_mine_location) {    ask my_friends {     do add_belief(known_empty_goldmine);    }   }   do remove_intention(share_information, true);  }       enforcement of the social norm Finally for the gold-miner agent, an enforcement is defined about the social norm to communicate the location of mines to other agents.

Install Eclipse Mars SR2  Download the  Eclipse IDE for Java and DSL Developers  version (If Java is not installed on your computer you can download it here).  Unpack it and launch it. Please refer to this link for more information on running Eclipse.  One important step required for GAMA to correctly produce its supporting files once it will have been installed is to set the default encoding of the workspace to UTF-8. It can be done by selecting, in the Preferences,  General , then  Workspace , then  Text file encoding  and choosing  UTF-8  in the drop-down menu available in  Other: .  If you install another version of Eclipse, please keep in mind that GAMA is compatible only, for the moment, with XText 2.9.1 (see here to obtain it).  Install GAMA source code  The source is to be downloaded from GitHub in two steps: by creating a local clone of the GitHub repository and then importing the different projects that constitute GAMA into the Eclipse workspace.     Open the Git perspective:   * Windows > Perspective > Open Perspective > Other…   * Choose Git    Click on  Clone a Git repository     * In Source Git repository window:  Fill in the URI label with: https://github.com/gama-platform/gama.git       Other fields will be automatically filled in.   * In Branch Selection windows,       check the mars branch       Next       Note: If you are using Ubuntu 16 and you did not find any branch in this windows, may be your eclipse has a bug related with the OS. The workaround should be:   Close eclipse Open eclipse.ini Add these 2 lines before –launcher.appendVmargs:  –launcher.GTK_version    2   * Change required version of java from : -Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=1.7 into -Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=1.8   * Remove this line: -XX:MaxPermSize=256m   * Save and close eclipse.ini   * Start eclipse and redo from step 1    In Local Destination windows,  Choose a Directory (where the source files will be downloaded).       Everything else should be unchecked       Finish   This can take a while…  Import projects into workspace You have now to import projects into the workspace (notice that the folders downloaded during the clone will neither be copied nor moved).     In the Git perspective and the Git Repositories view, Right-Click on  Working Tree  inside the gama repository, and choose  Import projects     * In the Select a wizard to use for importing projects window:   Import existing projects  should be checked        Working Tree  should be selected   * In Import Projects window:       Uncheck « Search for nested project »       Check the projects you want to import       Finish  Go back to the Java perspective   Clean project (Project menu > Clean …)   If you have errors… If errors continue to show on in the different projects, be sure to correctly set the JDK used in the Eclipse preferences. GAMA is targeting JDK 1.8, and Eclipse will produce errors if it not found in your environment. So, either you set the compatibility to 1.8 by default (in Preferences > Java > Compiler > Compiler Compliance Level) or you change the error produced by Eclipse to a warning only (in Preferences > Java > Compiler > Building >  No strictly compatible JRE for execution environment available).  Run GAMA    In the ummisco.gama.product plugin, open the gama.runtime.product file (gama.product is used to produce the release).

If you are not familiar with agent-based models or GAMA we advice you to have a look at the prey-predator model first.  Model Overview The model built in this tutorial concerns gold miners that try to find and sell gold nuggets. More precisely, we consider that several gold mines containing a certain amount of gold nuggets are located in the environnement. In the same way, a market where the miners can sell their gold nuggets is located in the environnment. The gold miners try to find gold mines, to extract gold nuggets from them and to sell the gold extracted nuggets at the market.

Emotions and Personality","content":"4. Emotions and Personality This fourth step consists in adding emotions that will impact the gold miner agent behavior and defining the personality of the agents.  Formulation    Definition of global emotions   Modification of the miner species to integrate emotions and personality   Emotions The BDI architecture of GAMA gives the possibility to generate emotions and to use them in the cognition. The definition of emotions in GAMA is based on the OCC theory of emotions. According to this theory, an emotion is a valued answer to the appraisal of a situation. In GAMA an emotion is represented by a set of 5 elements : * E: the name of the emotion felt by agent i. * P: the predicate that represents the fact about which the emotion is expressed. * A: the agent causing the emotion. * I: the intensity of the emotion. * D: the decay of the emotion s intensity.  The BDI architecture of GAMA integrates a dynamic creation of emotions processe that will create emotions according to the mental states of the agent. More precisely, twenty emotions can be created: eight emotions related to events, four emotions related to other agents and eight emotions related to actions.  The complete description of these emotions and their creation rules can be found in (Bourgais et at., 2017).  Personality In order to facilitate the parametrization of the BDI agents, we add the possibility to define all the parameters related to the BDI architecture through the OCEAN model, which proposes to represent the personality of a person according to five factors (correspoding to the 5 variables of the BDI agents): * O: represents the openness of someone (open-minded/narrow-minded). * C: represents the consciousness  of someone (act with preparations/impulsive). * E: represents the extroversion of someone (extrovert/shy). * A: represents the agreeableness of someone (friendly/hostile). * N: represent the degree of control someone has on its emotions (calm/neurotic) \\end{itemize}  Each of these variables has a value between 0 and 1. 0.5 represents the neutral value, below 0.5, the value is considered negatively and above 0.5, it is considered positively. For example, someone with a value of 1 for N is considered as calm and someone with a value of 0 for A is considered as hostile.  Model Definition ### emotions We add a new global emotion called joy that represents the joy emotion.  global {  ...  emotion joy <- new_emotion(joy);  ... }   emotions and personality To use emotions (and to activate the automatic emotion generation process), we just have to set the value of the built-in variable use_emotions_architecture to true (false by default). In our case, one of the possible desires concerns the predicate has_gold, and when an agent fulfill this desire and find a gold nugget (plan getGold), it gets the belief has_gold, and the emotion engine automatically creates a joy emotion.  To be able to define the parameter of a BDI agent through the OCEAN model, we have to set the value of the built-in variable use_personality to true (false by default). In this model, we chose to use the default value of the O, C, E, A and N variables (default value: 0.5). The interest of using the personality in our case is to allows the emotion engine to give a lifetime to the created emotions (otherwise, the emotions would have a infinite lifetime).  In this model, we only use the emotions to define if the miner agents is going to share or not its knowledge about the gold mines. We consider that the miner only shares information if it has a joy emotion.     species miner skills: moving control:simple_bdi {  …  bool use_emotions_architecture <- true;  bool use_personality <- true;  perceive target:goldmine where (each.quantity > 0) in:viewdist {  focus mine_at_location var:location;  ask myself {   if (has_emotion(joy)) {do add_desire(predicate:share_information, strength: 5.0);}   do remove_intention(find_gold, false);  } }     ... }       Complete Model      model GoldBdi  global {  int nb_mines <- 10;   int nbminer<-5;  market the_market;  string mine_at_location <- mine_at_location; string empty_mine_location <- empty_mine_location;  float step <- 10#mn;  //possible predicates concerning miners predicate mine_location <- new_predicate(mine_at_location) ; predicate choose_goldmine <- new_predicate(choose a gold mine); predicate has_gold <- new_predicate(extract gold); predicate find_gold <- new_predicate(find gold) ; predicate sell_gold <- new_predicate(sell gold) ; predicate share_information <- new_predicate(share information) ;   emotion joy <- new_emotion(joy);  float inequality <- 0.0 update:standard_deviation(miner collect each.gold_sold);  geometry shape <- square(20 #km); init {  create market {   the_market <- self;   }  create goldmine number:nb_mines;  create miner number:nbminer; }  reflex end_simulation when: sum(goldmine collect each.quantity) = 0 and empty(miner where each.has_belief(has_gold)){  do pause; } }   species goldmine {  int quantity <- rnd(1,20);  aspect default  {   if (quantity = 0) {    draw triangle(200) color: #gray border: #black;    } else {    draw triangle(200 + quantity*50) color: #yellow border: #black;    }  } }   species market {  int golds;  aspect default  {    draw square(1000) color: #black ;  } }  species miner skills: moving control:simple_bdi {  float viewdist<-1000.0; float speed <- 2#km/#h; rgb mycolor<-rnd_color(255); point target; int gold_sold;      bool use_social_architecture <- true; bool use_emotions_architecture <- true; bool use_personality <- true;  init {  do add_desire(find_gold); }  perceive target:miner in:viewdist {  socialize liking: 1 -  point(mycolor.red, mycolor.green, mycolor.blue) distance_to point(myself.mycolor.red, myself.mycolor.green, myself.mycolor.blue) / ( 255); }   perceive target:goldmine where (each.quantity > 0) in:viewdist {  focus id:mine_at_location var:location;  ask myself {   if (has_emotion(joy)) {do add_desire(predicate:share_information, strength: 5.0);}   do remove_intention(find_gold, false);  } }  rule belief: mine_location new_desire: has_gold strength: 2.0; rule belief: has_gold new_desire: sell_gold strength: 3.0;  plan letsWander intention:find_gold  {  do wander; }  plan getGold intention:has_gold  {  if (target = nil) {   do add_subintention(has_gold,choose_goldmine, true);   do current_intention_on_hold();  } else {   do goto target: target ;   if (target = location)  {    goldmine current_mine<- goldmine first_with (target = each.location);    if current_mine.quantity > 0 {      do add_belief(has_gold);     ask current_mine {quantity <- quantity - 1;}     } else {     do add_belief(new_predicate(empty_mine_location, location_value::target));    }    target <- nil;   }  }  }  plan choose_closest_goldmine intention: choose_goldmine instantaneous: true{  list<point> possible_mines <- get_beliefs_with_name(mine_at_location) collect (point(get_predicate(mental_state (each)).valueslocation_value));  list<point> empty_mines <- get_beliefs_with_name(empty_mine_location) collect (point(get_predicate(mental_state (each)).valueslocation_value));  possible_mines <- possible_mines - empty_mines;  if (empty(possible_mines)) {   do remove_intention(has_gold, true);   } else {   target <- (possible_mines with_min_of (each distance_to self)).location;  }  do remove_intention(choose_goldmine, true);  }  plan return_to_base intention: sell_gold {  do goto target: the_market ;  if (the_market.location = location)  {   do remove_belief(has_gold);   do remove_intention(sell_gold, true);   gold_sold <- gold_sold + 1;  } } plan share_information_to_friends intention: share_information instantaneous: true{  list<miner> my_friends <- list<miner>((social_link_base where (each.liking > 0)) collect each.agent);  loop known_goldmine over: get_beliefs_with_name(mine_at_location) {   ask my_friends {    do add_belief(known_goldmine);   }  }  loop known_empty_goldmine over: get_beliefs_with_name(empty_mine_location) {   ask my_friends {    do add_belief(known_empty_goldmine);   }  }    do remove_intention(share_information, true);  }  aspect default {   draw circle(200) color: mycolor border: #black depth: gold_sold; } }   experiment GoldBdi type: gui {  output {   display map type: opengl   {    species market ;    species goldmine ;    species miner;   }  } }     Back to the start of the tutorial   1.

BDI Agents This second step consists in defining the gold miner agents using the GAMA BDI architecture.  Formulation    Definition of global predicates   Definition of the gold miner species   Definition of the gold miner perceptions   Definition of the gold miner rules   Definition of the gold miner plans   Creation and display of the gold miners   BDI agents A classic paradigm to formalize the internal architecture of cognitive agents in Agent-Oriented Software Engineering is the BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) paradigm. This paradigm, based on the philosophy of action (Bratman, 1987), allows to design expressive and realistic agents.  The concepts of Belief-Desire-Intention can be summarized as follow for the the Gold Miner: the Miner agent has a general desire to find gold. As it is the only thing it wants at the beginning, it is its initial intention (what it is currently doing). To find gold, it wanders around (its plan is to wander). When it perceives some gold nuggets, it stores this information (it has a new belief about the existence and location of this gold nugget), and it adopts a new desire (it wants to extract the gold). When it perceives a gold nugget, the intention to find gold is put on hold and a new intention is selected (to extract gold). To achieve this intention, the plan has two steps, i.e. two new (sub)intentions: to choose a gold nugget to extract (among its known gold nuggets) and to go and take it. And so on.  In GAMA, we propose a control architecture for agents based on this paradigm. This control architecture provides the agents with 3 database linked to the agent cognition: * belief_base (what it knows): the internal knowledge the agent has about the world or about its internal state, updated during the simulation. A belief can concern any type of information (a quantity, a location, a boolean value, etc). * desire_base (what it wants): objectives that the agent would like to accomplish, also updated during the simulation. Desires can have hierarchical links (sub/super desires) when a desire is created as an intermediary objective. * intention_base (what it is doing): what the agent has chosen to do. The current intention will determine the selected plan. Intentions can be put on hold (for example when they require a sub-intention to be achieved).  In addition, the BDI architecture provides agents with three types of behavior structures * Perception: a perception is a function executed at each iteration to update the agent s Belief base, to know the changes in its environment (the world, the other agents and itself). The agent can perceive other agents up to a fixed distance or inside a specific geometry.  * Rule: a rule is a function executed at each iteration to infer new desires or beliefs from the agent s current beliefs and desires, i.e. a new desire or belief can emerge from the existing ones.  * Plan: the agent has a set of plans, which are behaviors defined to accomplish specific intentions. Plans can be instantaneous and/or persistent, and may have a priority value (that can be dynamic), used to select a plan when several possible plans are available to accomplish the same intention.  To be more precise on the behavior of BDI agents (what the agent is going to do when activated), this one is composed of 10 steps (see (Caillou et al., 2017) and (Taillandier et al., 2016) for more details): 1. Perceive: Perceptions are executed. 1. Rule: Rules are executed. 1. Is one of my intentions achieved?: If one of my intentions is achieved, sets the current plan to nil and removes the intention from the intention base. If the achieved intention s super-intention is on hold, it is reactivated (its sub-intention just got completed). 1. Do I keep the current intention?: To take into account the environment instability, an intention-persistence coefficient is applied: with this probability, the current intention is removed from the intention stack.  1. Do I have a current plan?: If I have a current plan, just execute it. Similarly to intentions, a plan-persistence coefficient is defined: with this probability, the current plan is just dropped. 1. Choose a desire as new current intention: If the current intention is on hold (or the intention base is empty), choose a desire as new current intention. The new selected intention is the desire with higher priority. 1. Choose a plan as a new current plan: The new current plan is selected among the plans compatible with the current intention (and if their activation condition is checked) and with the highest priority. 1. Execute the plan: The current plan is executed. 1. Is my plan finished?: To allow persistent plans, a plan may have a termination condition. If it is not reached, the same plan will be kept for the next iteration. 1. Was my plan instantaneous?: Most agent based simulation frameworks (GAMA included) are synchronous frameworks using steps. One consequence is that it may be useful to apply several plans during one single step. For example, if a step represents a day or a year, it would be unrealistic for an agent to spend one step to apply a plan like  choose a destination . This kind of plans (mostly reasoning plans) can be defined as instantaneous: in this case a new thinking loop is applied during the same agent step.  The architecture introduces two new main types of variables related to cognition:  * predicate: a predicate unifies the representation of the information about the world. It can represent a situation, an event or an action.     mental_state: it represents the element (belief, desire, intention) manipulated by the agent and the architecture to take a decision. A mental state is composed of a modality, a predicate or another mental state, a real value and a lifetime. The modality indicates the type of the mental state (e.g. a belief or a desire), the predicate indicates the fact about which is this mental state (a mental state can also be about another mental state like a belief about a belief, etc), the value has a different interpretation depending on the modality and finally, the lifetime indicate the duration of the mental state (it can be infinite).   Model Definition ### predicates As a first step of the integration of the BDI agents in our model, we define a set of global predicate that will represent all the information that will be manipulated by the miner agents: * mine_location: represents the information about the location of a gold mine. * choose_goldmine: represents the information that the miner wants to choose a gold mine. * has_gold: represents the information that the miner has a gold nugget. * find_gold: represents the information that the miner wants to find gold. * sell_gold: represents the information that the miner wants to sell gold.  We define as well two global string (mine_at_location and empty_mine_location) for simplification purpose and to avoid misspellings.     global {  …  string mine_at_location <-  mine_at_location ;  string empty_mine_location <-  empty_mine_location ;  predicate mine_location <- new_predicate(mine_at_location) ; predicate choose_goldmine <- new_predicate(choose a gold mine); predicate has_gold <- new_predicate(extract gold); predicate find_gold <- new_predicate(find gold) ; predicate sell_gold <- new_predicate(sell gold) ;     ... }      ### skeleton of the miner species We then define a miner species with the _moving_ skill and the _simple_bdi_ control architecture. The miner agents have 5 variables: * _viewdist_: distance of perception of the miner agent * _speed_: speed of the agent * _mycolor_: the color of the agent (random color) * _target_: where the agent wants to go * _gold_sold_: the number of gold nuggets sold by the agent   We define the init block of the species such as to add at the creation of the agent the desire to find gold nuggets (find_gold predicate). we use for that the add_desire action provides with the BDI architecture.  At last, we define an aspect in which we draw the agent with its mycolor color and with a depth that depends on the number of gold nuggets collected.       species miner skills: moving control:simple_bdi {  float viewdist<-1000.0;  float speed <- 2#km/#h;  rgb mycolor<-rnd_color(255);  point target;  int gold_sold;  init {  do add_desire(find_gold); } aspect default {  draw circle(200) color: mycolor border: #black depth: gold_sold; } }       perception We add a perceive statement for the miner agents. This perceive will allow to detect the gold mine that are not empty (i.e. the quantity of gold is higher than 0) at a distance lower or equal to  viewdist . The use of the focus statement allows to add for each detected goldmine a belief corresponding to the location of this goldmine. The name of the belief will be  mine_at_location  and the location value of the goldmine will be stored in the values (a map) variable of the belief at the key  location_value .  In addition, we ask the miner agent to remove the intention to find gold, allowing the agent to choose a new intention. The boolean value of the remove_intention action is used to specify if the agent should or not remove the given intention from the desire base as well. In our case, we choose to keep the desire to find golds.   species miner skills: moving control:simple_bdi {  ...   perceive target:goldmine where (each.quantity > 0) in:viewdist {   focus id:mine_at_location var:location;   ask myself {    do remove_intention(find_gold, false);   }  } }   Note that the perceive statement works as the ask statement: the instructions written in the statement are executed in the context of the perceive agents. It is for that that we have to use the myself keyword to ask the miner agent to execute the remove_intention action.  rules We define two rules for the miner agents: * if the agent believes that there is somewhere at least one gold mine with gold nuggets, the agent gets the new desire to has a gold nugget with a strength of 2.  * if the agent believes that it has a gold nugget, the agent gets the new desire to sell the gold nugget with a strength of 3.   species miner skills: moving control:simple_bdi {  ...  rule belief: mine_location new_desire: has_gold strength: 2.0;  rule belief: has_gold new_desire: sell_gold strength: 3.0; }   The strength of a desire will be used when selecting a desire as a new intention: the agent will choose as new intention the one with the highest strength. In our model, if the agent has the desires to find gold, to has gold and to sell gold, it will choose as intention to sell gold as it is the one with the highest strength. It is possible to replace this deterministic choice by a probabilistic one by setting the probabilistic_choice built-in varibale of the BDI agent to true (false by default).  plans  The last (and most important) part of the definition of BDI agents consist in defining the plans that the agents can carry out to acheive its intention.  The first plan called letsWander is defined to achieve the find_gold intention. This plan will just consists in executing the wander action of the moving skill (random move).  species miner skills: moving control:simple_bdi {  ...  plan letsWander intention:find_gold   {   do wander;  } ... }   The second plan called getGold is defined to achieve the has_gold intention. if the agent has no target (it does not know where to go), it adds a new sub-intention to choose a goldmine and put the current intention on hold (the agent will wait to select a gold mine to go before executing again this plan). The add_subintention has 3 arguments: the sub-intention (choose_goldmine), the super intention (extract_gold) and a boolean that defines if the sub-intention should or not be added as well as a desire. If the agent has already a target, it moves toward this target using the goto action of the moving skill. If the agent reaches its target - goldmine - (target = location), the agent tries to extract gold nuggets from it. If the corresponding goldmine (that one located at the target location) is not empty, the agent extract a gold nugget from it: the agent adds the belief that it has a gold nugget, then the quantity of golds in the gold mine is reduced. Otherwise, if the gold mine is empty, the agent adds the belief that this gold mine is empty. then the target is set to nil.   species miner skills: moving control:simple_bdi {  ...  plan getGold intention:has_gold  {   if (target = nil) {    do add_subintention(has_gold,choose_goldmine, true);    do current_intention_on_hold();   } else {    do goto target: target ;    if (target = location)  {     goldmine current_mine<- goldmine first_with (target = each.location);     if current_mine.quantity > 0 {       do add_belief(has_gold);      ask current_mine {quantity <- quantity - 1;}      } else {      do add_belief(new_predicate(empty_mine_location, location_value::target));     }     target <- nil;    }   }   } ... }   The third plan called choose_closest_goldmine is defined to achieve the choose_goldmine intention that is instantaneous. First, the agent defines the list of all the gold mines it knows (mine_at_location beliefs), then removes the gold mines that it knows that they are empty (empty_mine_location beliefs). If the list of the possible mines is empty, the agent removes the desire and the intention to extract_gold. We use for that the remove_intention action, that removes an intention from the intention base; the second argument allows to define if the intention should be removed as well from the desire base. If the agent knows at least one gold mine that is not empty, it defines as its new target the closest gold mine.   species miner skills: moving control:simple_bdi {  ...  plan choose_closest_goldmine intention: choose_goldmine instantaneous: true{   list<point> possible_mines <- get_beliefs_with_name(mine_at_location) collect (point(get_predicate(mental_state (each)).valueslocation_value));   list<point> empty_mines <- get_beliefs_with_name(empty_mine_location) collect (point(get_predicate(mental_state (each)).valueslocation_value));   possible_mines <- possible_mines - empty_mines;   if (empty(possible_mines)) {    do remove_intention(extract_gold, true);    } else {    target <- (possible_mines with_min_of (each distance_to self)).location;   }   do remove_intention(choose_goldmine, true);   } ... }   The last plan called return_to_base is defined to achieve the sell_gold intention. The agent moves in direction of the market using the goto action. if the agent reaches the market, it sells its gold nugget to it: first, it removes the belief that it has a gold nugget, then it removes the intention and the desire to sell golds, at last it increments its gold_sold variable.   species miner skills: moving control:simple_bdi {  ...  plan return_to_base intention: sell_gold {   do goto target: the_market ;   if (the_market.location = location)  {    do remove_belief(has_gold);    do remove_intention(sell_gold, true);    gold_sold <- gold_sold + 1;   }  } ... }  ## Gobal section We define two new global variables: * nbminer: number of gold miners * inequality: recomputed at each simulation step: standard deviation of the number of gold nuggets extracted per miners.  In the global init, after creating the gold mines and the market, we create the gold miner agents.  At last, we define a global reflex end_simulation that is activated when all the gold mines are empty and no more miner has a gold nuggets and that pauses the simulation.     global {  …  int nbminer<-5;  float inequality <- 0.0 update:standard_deviation(miner collect each.gold_sold);  …  init  {   …   create miner number:nbminer;  }  reflex end_simulation when: sum(goldmine collect each.quantity) = 0 and empty(miner where each.has_belief(has_gold)){  do pause; } }       Map display We add to the map display the miner species.     experiment GoldBdi type: gui {  output {  display map type: opengl  {   species market ;   species goldmine ;   species miner;  } } }     ## Complete Model       model GoldBdi  global {  int nb_mines <- 10;   int nbminer<-5;  market the_market;  string mine_at_location <- mine_at_location; string empty_mine_location <- empty_mine_location;  float step <- 10#mn;  //possible predicates concerning miners predicate mine_location <- new_predicate(mine_at_location) ; predicate choose_goldmine <- new_predicate(choose a gold mine); predicate has_gold <- new_predicate(extract gold); predicate find_gold <- new_predicate(find gold) ; predicate sell_gold <- new_predicate(sell gold) ;    float inequality <- 0.0 update:standard_deviation(miner collect each.gold_sold);  geometry shape <- square(20 #km);  init {  create market {   the_market <- self;   }  create goldmine number:nb_mines;  create miner number:nbminer; }  reflex end_simulation when: sum(goldmine collect each.quantity) = 0 and empty(miner where each.has_belief(has_gold)){  do pause; } }   species goldmine {  int quantity <- rnd(1,20);  aspect default  {   if (quantity = 0) {    draw triangle(200) color: #gray border: #black;    } else {    draw triangle(200 + quantity*50) color: #yellow border: #black;    }  } }   species market {  int golds;  aspect default  {    draw square(1000) color: #black ;  } }  species miner skills: moving control:simple_bdi {  float viewdist<-1000.0; float speed <- 2#km/#h; rgb mycolor<-rnd_color(255); point target; int gold_sold;  init {  do add_desire(find_gold); }   perceive target:goldmine where (each.quantity > 0) in:viewdist {  focus id:mine_at_location var:location;  ask myself {   do remove_intention(find_gold, false);  } } rule belief: mine_location new_desire: has_gold strength: 2.0; rule belief: has_gold new_desire: sell_gold strength: 3.0;    plan letsWander intention:find_gold  {  do wander; }  plan getGold intention:has_gold  {  if (target = nil) {   do add_subintention(has_gold,choose_goldmine, true);   do current_intention_on_hold();  } else {   do goto target: target ;   if (target = location)  {    goldmine current_mine<- goldmine first_with (target = each.location);    if current_mine.quantity > 0 {      do add_belief(has_gold);     ask current_mine {quantity <- quantity - 1;}     } else {     do add_belief(new_predicate(empty_mine_location, location_value::target));    }    target <- nil;   }  }  }  plan choose_closest_goldmine intention: choose_goldmine instantaneous: true{  list<point> possible_mines <- get_beliefs_with_name(mine_at_location) collect (point(get_predicate(mental_state (each)).valueslocation_value));  list<point> empty_mines <- get_beliefs_with_name(empty_mine_location) collect (point(get_predicate(mental_state (each)).valueslocation_value));  possible_mines <- possible_mines - empty_mines;  if (empty(possible_mines)) {   do remove_intention(has_gold, true);   } else {   target <- (possible_mines with_min_of (each distance_to self)).location;  }  do remove_intention(choose_goldmine, true);  }  plan return_to_base intention: sell_gold {  do goto target: the_market ;  if (the_market.location = location)  {   do remove_belief(has_gold);   do remove_intention(sell_gold, true);   gold_sold <- gold_sold + 1;  } }  aspect default {   draw circle(200) color: mycolor border: #black depth: gold_sold; } }   experiment GoldBdi type: gui {  output {  display map type: opengl  {   species market ;   species goldmine ;   species miner;  } } }     Back to the start of the tutorial(BDIAgents)   1.

Formulation    Definition of the gold mine species   Definition of the market species   Creation of the gold mine and market agents   Definition of a display with the gold mines and the market   Model Definition  species In this first model, we have to define two species of agents: the goldmine agents and the market ones. These agents will not have a particular behavior, they will just be displayed. For the goldmine species, we define a new attribute: quantity of type int, with for initial value a random integer between 0 and 20. We also define aspect called default that displays the goldmine as a triangle with a gray color if the gold mine is empty, yellow otherwise. The size of the triangle depends on the quantity of gold nuggets in the mine.  Concerning the market species, we define a new attribute: golds of type int. We define as well an aspect called default that displays the market as a blue square.      species goldmine {  int quantity <- rnd(1,20);  aspect default  {   if (quantity = 0) {    draw triangle(200) color: #gray border: #black;    } else {    draw triangle(200 + quantity*50) color: #yellow border: #black;    }  } }   species market {  int golds;  aspect default  {    draw square(1000) color: #black ;  } }      ### global variables We define two global variables for the model: one called nb_mines that will be used to define the number of mines and that will be set to 10. One call the_market that will represent the market agent (that will be unique).  In addition, we define the duration of a simulation step to 10 minutes, and we define the shape of the environnement by a square with a side size of 20 kilometers.      global {  int nb_mines <- 10;   market the_market;  float step <- 10#mn;  geometry shape <- square(20 #km); }      ### global init At the initialisation of the model, we create a market agent and nb_mines goldmine agents.

Example of application domains where GAMA is mostly present : * Transport * Urban planning * Epidemiology * Environment  Some training sessions about topics such as  urban management ,  epidemiology ,  risk management  are also provided by the team. Since GAMA is an open-source software that continues to grow, if you have any particular needs for improvement, feel free to share it to its active community !    High level and intuitive language  Thanks to its high-level and intuitive language, GAMA has been developed to be used by non-computer scientists. You can declare your species, giving them some special behaviors, create them in your world, and display them in less than 10 minutes.  GAML is the language used in GAMA, coded in Java. It is an agent-based language, that provides you the possibility to build your model with several paradigms of modeling. Once your model is ready, some features allow you to explore and calibrate it, using the parameters you defined as input of your simulation.  We provide you a continual support through the active mailing list where the team will answer your questions. Besides, you can learn GAML on your own, following the step by step tutorial, or personal learning path in order reach the point you are interested in.    GIS and Data-Driven models  GAMA (GIS Agent-based Modeling Architecture) provides you, since its creation, the possibility to load easily GIS (Geographic Information System).  You can import a large number of data types, such as text, files, CSV, shapefile, OSM (open street map data), grid, images, SVG, but also 3D files, such as 3DS or OBJ, with their texture.  Some advanced features provide you the possibility to connect GAMA to databases, and also to use powerful statistical tools such as R.  GAMA has been used in large-scale projects, using a great number of agents (up to millions of agents).    Declarative user interface  GAMA provides you the possibility to have multiple displays for the same model. You can add as many visual representations as you want for the same model, in order to highlight a certain aspect of your simulation. Add easily new visual aspects to your agents.  Advanced 3D displays are provided: you can control lights, cameras, and also adding textures to your 3D objects. On the other hand, dedicated statements allow you to define easily charts, such as series, histogram, or pies.  During the simulations, some advanced features are available to inspect the population of your agents. To make your model more interactive, you can add easily some user-controlled action panels, or mouse events.

The graphical editor plug-in is called Graphical_modeling and is directly available from the GAMA update site http://updates.gama-platform.org/graphical_modeling    Note that the graphical editor is still under development. Updates of the plug-in will be add to the GAMA website. After installing the plug-in (and periodically), check for updates for this plug-in: in the  Help  menu, choose  Check for Updates  and install the proposed updates for the graphical modeling plug-in.  Creating a first model  A new diagram can be created in a new GAMA project. First, right click on a project, then select  New  on the contextual menu. In the New Wizard, select  GAMA -> Model Diagram , then  Next>    In the next Wizard dialog, select the type of diagram (Empty, Skeleton or Example) then the name of the file and the author.    Skeleton and Example diagram types allow to add to the diagram some basic features.  Status of models in editors  Similarly to GAML editor, the graphical editor proposes a live display of errors and model statuses. A graphical model can actually be in three different states, which are visually accessible above the editing area: Functional (orange color), Experimentable (green color) and InError (red color). See the section on model validation for more precise information about these statuses.  In its initial state, a model is always in the Functional state, which means it compiles without problems, but cannot be used to launch experiments. The InError state occurs when the file contains errors (syntactic or semantic ones).  Reaching the Experimentable state requires that all errors are eliminated and that at least one experiment is defined in the model. The experiment is immediately displayed as a button in the toolbar, and clicking on it will allow to launch this experiment on your model.  Experiment buttons are updated in real-time to reflect what s in your code. If more than one experiment is defined, corresponding buttons will be displayed in addition to the first one.  Diagram definition framework  The following figure presents the editing framework:   Features  agents #### species    The species feature allows to define a species with a continuous topology. A species is always a micro-species of another species. The top level (macro-species of all species) is the world species.     source: a species (macro-species)   target: -    grid    The grid feature allows to define a species with a grid topology. A grid is always a micro-species of another species.     source: a species (macro-species)   target: -     Inheriting link The inheriting link feature allows to define an inheriting link between two species.     source: a species (parent)   target: a species (child)     world    When a model is created, a world species is always defined.

Social relation","content":"3. Social relation This third step consists in adding social relation between agents and the possibility to share information about the known gold mines.  Formulation    Definition of global predicates   Definition of the gold miner species   Definition of the gold miner perceptions with socialization   Definition of a new gold miner plan to share information   Social relation The BDI architecture of GAMA allows to define explicit social relations between agents. Based on the work of Svennevig, a social link with another agent is defined as a tuple <agent,liking, dominance, solidarity, familiarity, trust> with the following elements: * Agent: the agent concerned by the link, identified by its name. * Liking: a real value between -1 and 1 representing the degree of liking with the agent concerned by the link. A value of -1 indicates that the concerned agent is hated, a value of 1 indicates that the concerned agent is liked. * Dominance: a real value between -1 and 1 representing the degree of power exerted on the agent concerned by the link. A value of -1 indicates that the concerned agent is dominating, a value of 1 indicates that the concerned agent is dominated.– Solidarity: a real value between 0 and 1 representing the degree of solidarity with the agent concerned by the link. A value of 0 indicates no solidarity with the concerned agent, a value of 1 indicates a complete solidarity with the concerned agent. * Familiarity: a real value between 0 and 1 representing the degree of familiarity with the agent concerned by the link. A value of 0 indicates no familiarity with the concerned agent, a value of 1 indicates a complete familiarity with the concerned agent.  * Trust : a real value between -1 and +1 representing the degree of trust with the agent concerned by th link. A value of -1 indicates a doubt about the agent concerned, a value of 1 indicates a complete trust with the concerned agent.  With this definition, a social relation is not necessarily symmetric. For example, let s take two agents, Alice and Bob, with a social link towards each other. The agent Bob may have a social link <Alice,1,-0.5,0.6,0.8,-0.2> (Bob likes Alice with a value of 1, he thinks he is dominated by Alice, he is solidary with Alice with a value of 0.6, he is familiar with Alice with a value of 0.8 and he doubts about her with a value 0.2) and Alice may have a social link <Bob,-0.2,0.2,0.4,0.5,0.8> (Alice dislikes Bob with a value of 0.2, she thinks she is dominating Bob, she is solidary with Bob with a value of 0.4, she is familiar with Bob with a value of 0.5 and she trusts Bob with a value of 0.5).  Model Definition ### predicates We add a new global predicate called share_information that represents the information that the miner wants to share information.  global {  ...  predicate share_information <- new_predicate(share information) ;  ... }   perception We add a new perceive statement for the miner agents. This perceive will allow to create a social relation with the miners that are located at a distance lower or equal to  viewdist  to the agent.  For each of these miner agents, the agents create a new social relation using the socialize statement with a liking value that depends on the color of the agents: more the agent are close, higher will be the liking value.   species miner skills: moving control:simple_bdi {  ...  perceive target:miner in:viewdist {   socialize liking: 1 -  point(mycolor.red, mycolor.green, mycolor.blue) distance_to point(myself.mycolor.red, myself.mycolor.green, myself.mycolor.blue) / ( 255);  } }   We also modify the perceive statement previously defined in order to add the desire to share information with a strength of 5 if the agent finds a gold mine.   species miner skills: moving control:simple_bdi {  ...  perceive target:goldmine where (each.quantity > 0) in:viewdist {   focus mine_at_location var:location;   ask myself {    do add_desire(predicate:share_information, strength: 5.0);    do remove_intention(find_gold, false);   }  }   plan At last, we add a new plan for the miner agents called share_information_to_friends to achieve the intention share_information that is instantaneous. In this plan, the miner agent first defines its list of friends, i.e. the miners with which it has a social link and that it likes (linking higher than 0). then for each friend, it share its list of known mines (beliefs about their location), then its knowledge about the mines that are empty (beliefs about their location). At last, it removes the desire and intention to share_information.      species miner skills: moving control:simple_bdi {  …  plan share_information_to_friends intention: share_information instantaneous: true{   list my_friends <- list((social_link_base where (each.liking > 0)) collect each.agent);   loop known_goldmine over: get_beliefs_with_name(mine_at_location) {    ask my_friends {     do add_belief(known_goldmine);    }   }   loop known_empty_goldmine over: get_beliefs_with_name(empty_mine_location) {    ask my_friends {     do add_belief(known_empty_goldmine);    }   }   do remove_intention(share_information, true);  } }       Complete Model      model GoldBdi  global {  int nb_mines <- 10;   int nbminer<-5;  market the_market;  string mine_at_location <- mine_at_location; string empty_mine_location <- empty_mine_location;  float step <- 10#mn;  //possible predicates concerning miners predicate mine_location <- new_predicate(mine_at_location) ; predicate choose_goldmine <- new_predicate(choose a gold mine); predicate has_gold <- new_predicate(extract gold); predicate find_gold <- new_predicate(find gold) ; predicate sell_gold <- new_predicate(sell gold) ; predicate share_information <- new_predicate(share information) ;  float inequality <- 0.0 update:standard_deviation(miner collect each.gold_sold);  geometry shape <- square(20 #km); init {  create market {   the_market <- self;   }  create goldmine number:nb_mines;  create miner number:nbminer; }  reflex end_simulation when: sum(goldmine collect each.quantity) = 0 and empty(miner where each.has_belief(has_gold)){  do pause; } }   species goldmine {  int quantity <- rnd(1,20);  aspect default  {   if (quantity = 0) {    draw triangle(200) color: #gray border: #black;    } else {    draw triangle(200 + quantity*50) color: #yellow border: #black;    }  } }   species market {  int golds;  aspect default  {    draw square(1000) color: #black ;  } }  species miner skills: moving control:simple_bdi {  float viewdist<-1000.0; float speed <- 2#km/#h; rgb mycolor<-rnd_color(255); point target; int gold_sold;      bool use_social_architecture <- true;  init {  do add_desire(find_gold); }  perceive target:miner in:viewdist {  socialize liking: 1 -  point(mycolor.red, mycolor.green, mycolor.blue) distance_to point(myself.mycolor.red, myself.mycolor.green, myself.mycolor.blue) / ( 255); }   perceive target:goldmine where (each.quantity > 0) in:viewdist {  focus id: mine_at_location var:location;  ask myself {   do add_desire(predicate:share_information, strength: 5.0);   do remove_intention(find_gold, false);  } }  rule belief: mine_location new_desire: has_gold strength: 2.0; rule belief: has_gold new_desire: sell_gold strength: 3.0;    plan letsWander intention:find_gold  {  do wander; }  plan getGold intention:has_gold  {  if (target = nil) {   do add_subintention(has_gold,choose_goldmine, true);   do current_intention_on_hold();  } else {   do goto target: target ;   if (target = location)  {    goldmine current_mine<- goldmine first_with (target = each.location);    if current_mine.quantity > 0 {      do add_belief(has_gold);     ask current_mine {quantity <- quantity - 1;}     } else {     do add_belief(new_predicate(empty_mine_location, location_value::target));    }    target <- nil;   }  }  }  plan choose_closest_goldmine intention: choose_goldmine instantaneous: true{  list<point> possible_mines <- get_beliefs_with_name(mine_at_location) collect (point(get_predicate(mental_state (each)).valueslocation_value));  list<point> empty_mines <- get_beliefs_with_name(empty_mine_location) collect (point(get_predicate(mental_state (each)).valueslocation_value));  possible_mines <- possible_mines - empty_mines;  if (empty(possible_mines)) {   do remove_intention(has_gold, true);   } else {   target <- (possible_mines with_min_of (each distance_to self)).location;  }  do remove_intention(choose_goldmine, true);  }  plan return_to_base intention: sell_gold {  do goto target: the_market ;  if (the_market.location = location)  {   do remove_belief(has_gold);   do remove_intention(sell_gold, true);   gold_sold <- gold_sold + 1;  } } plan share_information_to_friends intention: share_information instantaneous: true{  list<miner> my_friends <- list<miner>((social_link_base where (each.liking > 0)) collect each.agent);  loop known_goldmine over: get_beliefs_with_name(mine_at_location) {   ask my_friends {    do add_belief(known_goldmine);   }  }  loop known_empty_goldmine over: get_beliefs_with_name(empty_mine_location) {   ask my_friends {    do add_belief(known_empty_goldmine);   }  }    do remove_intention(share_information, true);  }  aspect default {   draw circle(200) color: mycolor border: #black depth: gold_sold; } }   experiment GoldBdi type: gui {  output {   display map type: opengl   {    species market ;    species goldmine ;    species miner;   }  } }     Back to the start of the tutorial   1.

To this purpose, the network skill should be used on agents intending to use these capabilities.  Notice that in this communication, roles are asymetric: the simulations should contain a server and some clients to communicate. Message exchanges are made between agents through this server. 3 protocols are supported (TCP, UDP and MQTT): * when TCP or UDP protocols are used: one agent of the simulation is the server and the other ones are the clients. * when the MQTT protocol is used: all the agents are clients and the server is an external software. A free solution (ActiveMQ) can be freely downloaded from: http://activemq.apache.org.  Which protocol to use ?  In the GAMA network, 3 kinds of protocol can be used. Each of them has a particular purpose. * MQTT: this is the default protocol that should be used to make agents of various GAMA instances to communicate through a MQTT server (that should be run as an external application, e.g. ActiveMQ that can be downloaded from: http://activemq.apache.org/), * UDP: this protocol should be limited to fast (and unsecured) exchanges of small pieces of data from GAMA to an external application (for example, mouse location from a Processing application to GAMA, c.f. model library), * TCP: this protocol can be used both to communicate between GAMA applications or between GAMA and an external application.  Disclaimer  In all the models using any network communication, the server should be launched before the clients. As a consequence, when TCP or UDP protocols are used, a model creating a server agent should always be run first. Using MQTT protocol, the external software server should be launched before running any model using it.  Declaring a network species  To create agents able to communicate through a network, their species should have the skill network:  species Networking_Client skills: network {    ... }   A list exhaustive of the additional attributes and available actions provided by this skill are described here: network skill preference page.  Creation of a network agent  The network agents are created as any other agents, but (in general) at the creation of the agents, the connection is also created, using the connect built-in action:   create Networking_Client {     do connect to: localhost protocol: tcp_client port: 3001 with_name: Client; }   Each protocol has its specificities regarding the connection: * TCP:    * protocol: the 2 possibles keywords are tcp_server or tcp_client, depending on the wanted role of the agent in the communication.   * port: traditionally the port 3001 is used. * UDP:    * protocol: the 2 possibles keywords are udp_server or udp_emitter, depending on the wanted role of the agent in the communication.   * port: traditionally the port 9876 is used. * MQTT:    * protocol: MQTT is the default protocol value (if no value is given, MQTT will be used)  Sending messages  To send any message, the agent has to use the send action:        do send to: send contents: name +   + cycle +  sent to server;   Receiving messages  The messages sent by other agents are received in the mailbox attribute of each agent. So to get its new message, the agent has simply to check whether it has new messages (with action has_more_message() ) and fetch it (that is get it and remove it from the mailing box) with the action fetch_message().  reflex fetch when: has_more_message() {      message mess <- fetch_message();     write name +  fecth this message:  + mess.contents;  }   Alternatively, the mailbox attribute can be directly accessed (notice that the mailbox is a list of messages):  reflex receive {       if (length(mailbox) > 0) {  write mailbox;     } }   Broadcasting a message to all the agents members of a given group  Each time an agent create a connection to another agent as a client, a way to communicate with it is stored in the network_groups attribute.  So an agent can use this attribute to broadcast messages to all the agents with whose it can communicate:   reflex broad {     loop id over: network_groups {  do send to: id contents: I am Server  + name +  I give order to  + id;     } }   To go further: * network skill peference page. * examples model can be found in the GAMA model library, in: Plugin models > Network.
