* Get completely rid of GraphStream in favour of JGraphT for reading/writing graphs. Replace all odd reading operators by graph files for reading/writing
* Move to GeoTools 21.1, JTS 1.16.1, JGraphT 1.3.0, StreamEx 0.6.8
* Simplify the syntax by removing some alternatives (arguments passing to actions, for instance).
