When new features were developed, or when serious issues were fixed, the release you had on your disk, prior to GAMA 1.6.1, could not benefit from them. Since the version 1.6.1, however, GAMA has been enhanced to support a self\\\\update_ mechanism, which allows you to import from the GAMA update site additional plugins (offering new features) or updated versions of the plugins that constitute the core of GAMA.","sidebar":"side"},"Using_Git":{"id":"Using_Git","title":"Using Git from GAMA to version and share models","description":"To use Git in GAMA select Views -> Other... -> Show View -> Other...","sidebar":"side"},"Using-BEN-simple-bdi":{"id":"Using-BEN-simple-bdi","title":"Using BEN (simple_bdi)","description":"[//]: # (keyword|concept_bdi)","sidebar":"side"},"UsingDatabase":{"id":"UsingDatabase","title":"Using Database Access","description":"[//]: # (startConcept|use_database)","sidebar":"side"},"UsingDrivingSkill":{"id":"UsingDrivingSkill","title":"Advanced Driving Skill","description":"[//]: # (keyword|concept_transport)","sidebar":"side"},"UsingFIPAACL":{"id":"UsingFIPAACL","title":"Using FIPA ACL","description":"[//]: # (keyword|concept_fipa)","sidebar":"side"},"UsingNetwork":{"id":"UsingNetwork","title":"Using network","description":"[//]: # (keyword|concept_network)","sidebar":"side"},"ValidationOfModels":{"id":"ValidationOfModels","title":"Validation of Models","description":"When editing a model, GAMA will continuously validate (i.e. compile) what the modeler is entering and indicate, with specific visual affordances, various information on the state of the model.

To these purposes, the modeler can define a set of assertions that will be tested. Before the execution of the embedded set of instructions, if a setup is defined in the species, model or experiment, it is executed. In a test, if one assertion fails, the evaluation of other assertions continue.","sidebar":"side"}}}')}}]);
