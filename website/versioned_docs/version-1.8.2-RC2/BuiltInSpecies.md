It is possible to use in the models a set of built-in agents. These agents allow to directly use some advance features like clustering, multi-criteria analysis, etc. The creation of these agents are similar as for other kinds of agents:

```
create species: my_built_in_agent returns: the_agent;
```
    
So, for instance, to be able to use clustering techniques in the model:

```
create cluster_builder returns: clusterer;
```

## `base_edge`	
A built-in species for agents representing the edges of a graph, from which one can inherit

* **`target`** (`agent`): The target agent of this edge 
 	
### Actions
	
    	
----





## `experiment`	
An experiment is a declaration of the way to conduct simulations on a model. Any experiment attached to a model is a species (introduced by the keyword 'experiment' which directly or indirectly inherits from an abstract species called 'experiment' itself. This abstract species (sub-species of 'agent') defines several attributes and actions that can then be used in any experiment.
 'experiment' defines several attributes, which, in addition to the attributes inherited from agent, form the minimal set of knowledge any experiment will have access to.
 

### Variables

	   
* **`minimum_cycle_duration`** (`float`): The minimum duration (in seconds) a simulation cycle should last. Default is 0. Units can be used to pass values smaller than a second (for instance '10 Â°msec')   
* **`model_path`** (`string`): Contains the absolute path to the folder in which the current model is located   
* **`parameters`** (`map`): A parameters set of this experiment agent   
* **`project_path`** (`string`): Contains the absolute path to the project in which the current model is located   
* **`rng`** (`string`): The random number generator to use for this simulation. Three different ones are at the disposal of the modeler: mersenne represents the default generator, based on the Mersenne-Twister algorithm. Very reliable; cellular is a cellular automaton based generator that should be a bit faster, but less reliable; and java invokes the standard Java generator   
* **`rng_usage`** (`int`): Returns the number of times the random number generator of the experiment has been drawn   
* **`seed`** (`float`): The seed of the random number generator. Each time it is set, the random number generator is reinitialized. WARNING: Setting it to zero actually means that you let GAMA choose a random seed   
* **`simulation`** (`-27`): Contains a reference to the current simulation being run by this experiment   
* **`simulations`** (`list`): Contains the list of currently running simulations   
* **`warnings`** (`boolean`): The value of the preference 'Consider warnings as errors'   
* **`workspace_path`** (`string`): Contains the absolute path to the workspace of GAMA 
 	
### Actions

## `physical_world`	
The base species for models that act as a 3D physical world. Can register and manage agents provided with either the 'static_body' or 'dynamic_body' skill. Inherits from 'static_body', so it can also act as a physical body itself (with a 'mass', 'friction', 'gravity'), of course without motion -- in this case, it needs to register itself as a physical agent using the 'register' action
 

### Variables

	   
* **`accurate_collision_detection`** (`boolean`): Enables or not a better (but slower) collision detection   
* **`automated_registration`** (`boolean`): If set to true (the default), makes the world automatically register and unregister agents provided with either the 'static_body' or 'dynamic_body' skill. Otherwise, they must be registered using the 'register' action, which can be useful when only some agents need to be considered as 'physical agents'. Note that, in any case, the world needs to manually register itself if it is supposed to act as a physical body.   
* **`gravity`** (`point`): Defines the value of gravity in this world. The default value is set to -9.80665 on the z-axis, that is 9.80665 m/s2 towards the 'bottom' of the world. Can be set to any direction and intensity and applies to all the bodies present in the physical world   
* **`library`** (`string`): This attribute allows to manually switch between two physics library, named 'bullet' and 'box2D'. The Bullet library, which comes in two flavors (see 'use_native') and the Box2D libray in its Java version (https://github.com/jbox2d/jbox2d). Bullet is the default library but models in 2D should better use Box2D   
* **`max_substeps`** (`int`): If equal to 0 (the default), makes the simulation engine be stepped alongside the simulation (no substeps allowed). Otherwise, sets the maximum number of physical simulation substeps that may occur within one GAMA simulation step   
* **`terrain`** (`31`): This attribute is a matrix of float that can be used to represent a 3D terrain. The shape of the world, in that case, should be a box, where thedimension on the z-axis is used to scale the z-values of the DEM. The world needs to be register itself as a physical object   
* **`use_native`** (`boolean`): This attribute allows to manually switch between the Java version of the Bullet library (JBullet, a modified version of https://github.com/stephengold/jbullet, which corresponds to version 2.72 of the original library) and the native Bullet library (Libbulletjme, https://github.com/stephengold/Libbulletjme, which is kept up-to-date with the 3.x branch of the original library).The native version is the default one unless the libraries cannot be loaded, making JBullet the default 
 	
### Actions
	  
	 
#### **`register`**

**An action that allows to register agents in this physical world. Unregistered agents will not be governed by the physical laws of this world. If the world is to play a role in the physical world,then it needs to register itself (i.e. do register([self]);**


**Returned type:** `unknown`

##### Additional facets: 
  	 			
* **`bodies`** (container): the list or container of agents to register in this physical world
