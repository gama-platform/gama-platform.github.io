## General syntax

A statement represents either a declaration or an imperative command. It consists in a keyword, followed by specific facets, some of them mandatory (in bold), some of them optional. One of the facet names can be omitted (the one denoted as omissible). It has to be the first one.

```
statement_keyword expression1 facet2: expression2 ... ;
or
statement_keyword facet1: expression1 facet2: expression2 ...;
```

If the statement encloses other statements, it is called a **sequence statement**, and its sub-statements (either sequence statements or single statements) are declared between curly brackets, as in:

```
statement_keyword1 expression1 facet2: expression2... { // a sequence statement
     statement_keyword2 expression1 facet2: expression2...;  // a single statement
     statement_keyword3 expression1 facet2: expression2...;
}
```

[//]: # (keyword|statement_=)
### = 
#### Facets 
  
  * **`right`** (float), (omissible) : the right part of the equation (it is mandatory that it can be evaluated as a float  
  * **`left`** (any type): the left part of the equation (it should be a variable or a call to the diff() or diff2() operators) 
 	
#### Definition

Allows to implement an equation in the form function(n, t) = expression. The left function is only here as a placeholder for enabling a simpler syntax and grabbing the variable as its left member.

#### Usages

* The syntax of the = statement is a bit different from the other statements. It has to be used as follows (in an equation):

```
float t;
float S;
float I;
equation SI { 
   diff(S,t) = (- 0.3 * S * I / 100);
   diff(I,t) = (0.3 * S * I / 100);
} 
```

    
* See also: [equation](#equation), [solve](#solve), 

#### Embedments
* The `=` statement is of type: **Single statement**
* The `=` statement can be embedded into: equation, 
* The `=` statement embeds statements: 

----

[//]: # (keyword|statement_action)
### action 
#### Facets 
  
  * **`name`** (an identifier), (omissible) : identifier of the action
  * `index` (a datatype identifier): if the action returns a map, the type of its keys
  * `of` (a datatype identifier): if the action returns a container, the type of its elements
  * `type` (a datatype identifier): the action returned type
  * `virtual` (boolean): whether the action is virtual (defined without a set of instructions) (false by default) 
 	
#### Definition

Allows to define in a species, model or experiment a new action that can be called elsewhere.

#### Usages

* The simplest syntax to define an action that does not take any parameter and does not return anything is:

```
action simple_action {
   // [set of statements]
}
```


* If the action needs some parameters, they can be specified betwee, braquets after the identifier of the action:

```
action action_parameters(int i, string s){
   // [set of statements using i and s]
}
```


* If the action returns any value, the returned type should be used instead of the "action" keyword. A return statement inside the body of the action statement is mandatory.

```
int action_return_val(int i, string s){
   // [set of statements using i and s]
   return i + i;
}
```


* If virtual: is true, then the action is abstract, which means that the action is defined without body. A species containing at least one abstract action is abstract. Agents of this species cannot be created. The common use of an abstract action is to define an action that can be used by all its sub-species, which should redefine all abstract actions and implements its body.

```
species parent_species {
   int virtual_action(int i, string s);
}

species children parent: parent_species {
   int virtual_action(int i, string s) {
      return i + i;
   }
}
```

    
* See also: [do](#do), 

#### Embedments
* The `action` statement is of type: **Sequence of statements or action**
* The `action` statement can be embedded into: Species, Experiment, Model, 
* The `action` statement embeds statements: [return](#return),

[//]: # (keyword|statement_add)
### add 
#### Facets 
  
  * **`to`** (any type in [container, species, agent, geometry]): an expression that evaluates to a container
  * `item` (any type), (omissible) : any expression to add in the container
  * `all` (any type): Allows to either pass a container so as to add all its element, or 'true', if the item to add is already a container.
  * `at` (any type): position in the container of added element
  * `edge` (any type): a pair that will be added to a graph as an edge (if nodes do not exist, they are also added)
  * `node` (any type): an expression that will be added to a graph as a node.
  * `vertex` (any type): 
  * `weight` (float):  
 	
#### Definition

Allows to add, i.e. to insert, a new element in a container (a list, matrix, map, ...).Incorrect use: The addition of a new element at a position out of the bounds of the container will produce a warning and let the container unmodified. If all: is specified, it has no effect if its argument is not a container, or if its argument is 'true' and the item to add is not a container. In that latter case

#### Usages

* The new element can be added either at the end of the container or at a particular position.

```
add expr to: expr_container;    // Add at the end
add expr at: expr to: expr_container;   // Add at position expr
```


* Case of a list, the expression in the facet at: should be an integer.

```
list<int> workingList <- [];
add 0 at: 0 to: workingList ; 	// workingList equals [0]
add 10 at: 0 to: workingList ; 	// workingList equals [10,0]
add 20 at: 2 to: workingList ; 	// workingList equals [10,0,20]
add 50 to: workingList; 	// workingList equals [10,0,20,50]
add [60,70] all: true to: workingList; 	// workingList equals [10,0,20,50,60,70]
```


* Case of a map: As a map is basically a list of pairs key::value, we can also use the add statement on it. It is important to note that the behavior of the statement is slightly different, in particular in the use of the at facet, which denotes the key of the pair.

```
map<string,string> workingMap <- [];
add "val1" at: "x" to: workingMap; 	// workingMap equals ["x"::"val1"]
```


* If the at facet is omitted, a pair expr_item::expr_item will be added to the map. An important exception is the case where the expr_item is a pair: in this case the pair is added.

```
add "val2" to: workingMap; 	// workingMap equals ["x"::"val1", "val2"::"val2"]
add "5"::"val4" to: workingMap;  	// workingMap equals ["x"::"val1", "val2"::"val2", "5"::"val4"]
```


* Notice that, as the key should be unique, the addition of an item at an existing position (i.e. existing key) will only modify the value associated with the given key.

```
add "val3" at: "x" to: workingMap; 	// workingMap equals ["x"::"val3", "val2"::"val2", "5"::"val4"]
```


* On a map, the all facet will add all value of a container  in the map (so as pair val_cont::val_cont)

```
add ["val4","val5"] all: true at: "x" to: workingMap; 	// workingMap equals ["x"::"val3", "val2"::"val2", "5"::"val4","val4"::"val4","val5"::"val5"]
```


* In case of a graph, we can use the facets `node`, `edge` and `weight` to add a node, an edge or weights to the graph. However, these facets are now considered as deprecated, and it is advised to use the various edge(), node(), edges(), nodes() operators, which can build the correct objects to add to the graph 

```
graph g <- as_edge_graph([{1,5}::{12,45}]);
add edge: {1,5}::{2,3} to: g;
list var <- g.vertices; 	// var equals [{1,5},{12,45},{2,3}]
list var <- g.edges; 	// var equals [polyline({1.0,5.0}::{12.0,45.0}),polyline({1.0,5.0}::{2.0,3.0})]
add node: {5,5} to: g;
list var <- g.vertices; 	// var equals [{1.0,5.0},{12.0,45.0},{2.0,3.0},{5.0,5.0}]
list var <- g.edges; 	// var equals [polyline({1.0,5.0}::{12.0,45.0}),polyline({1.0,5.0}::{2.0,3.0})]
```


* Case of a matrix: this statement can not be used on matrix. Please refer to the statement put.    
* See also: [put](#put), [remove](#remove),

[//]: # (keyword|statement_agents)
### agents 
#### Facets 
  
  * **`value`** (container): the set of agents to display
  * `name` (a label), (omissible) : Human readable title of the layer
  * `aspect` (an identifier): the name of the aspect that should be used to display the species
  * `fading` (boolean): Used in conjunction with 'trace:', allows to apply a fading effect to the previous traces. Default is false
  * `focus` (agent): the agent on which the camera will be focused (it is dynamically computed)
  * `position` (point): position of the upper-left corner of the layer. Note that if coordinates are in [0,1[, the position is relative to the size of the environment (e.g. {0.5,0.5} refers to the middle of the display) whereas it is absolute when coordinates are greter than 1. The position can only be a 3D point {0.5, 0.5, 0.5}, the last coordinate specifying the elevation of the layer.
  * `refresh` (boolean): (openGL only) specify whether the display of the species is refreshed. (true by default, useful in case of agents that do not move)
  * `selectable` (boolean): Indicates whether the agents present on this layer are selectable by the user. Default is true
  * `size` (point): extent of the layer in the screen from its position. Coordinates in [0,1[ are treated as percentages of the total surface, while coordinates > 1 are treated as absolute sizes in model units (i.e. considering the model occupies the entire view). Like in 'position', an elevation can be provided with the z coordinate, allowing to scale the layer in the 3 directions
  * `trace` (any type in [boolean, int]): Allows to aggregate the visualization of agents at each timestep on the display. Default is false. If set to an int value, only the last n-th steps will be visualized. If set to true, no limit of timesteps is applied.
  * `transparency` (float): the transparency rate of the agents (between 0 and 1, 1 means no transparency) 
 	
#### Definition

`agents` allows the modeler to display only the agents that fulfill a given condition.

#### Usages

* The general syntax is:

```
display my_display {
   agents layer_name value: expression [additional options];
}
```


* For instance, in a segregation model, `agents` will only display unhappy agents:

```
display Segregation {
   agents agentDisappear value: people as list where (each.is_happy = false) aspect: with_group_color;
}
```

    
* See also: [display](#display), [chart](#chart), [event](#event), [graphics](#graphics), [display_grid](#display_grid), [image](#image), [overlay](#overlay), [display_population](#display_population),

[//]: # (keyword|statement_annealing)
### annealing 
#### Facets 
  
  * **`name`** (an identifier), (omissible) : 
  * `aggregation` (a label), takes values in: {min, max}: the agregation method
  * `maximize` (float): the value the algorithm tries to maximize
  * `minimize` (float): the value the algorithm tries to minimize
  * `nb_iter_cst_temp` (int): number of iterations per level of temperature
  * `temp_decrease` (float): temperature decrease coefficient
  * `temp_end` (float): final temperature
  * `temp_init` (float): initial temperature 
 	
#### Definition

This algorithm is an implementation of the Simulated Annealing algorithm. See the wikipedia article and [batch161 the batch dedicated page].

#### Usages

* As other batch methods, the basic syntax of the annealing statement uses `method annealing` instead of the expected `annealing name: id` : 

```
method annealing [facet: value];
```


* For example: 

```
method annealing temp_init: 100  temp_end: 1 temp_decrease: 0.5 nb_iter_cst_temp: 5 maximize: food_gathered;
```



#### Embedments
* The `annealing` statement is of type: **Batch method**
* The `annealing` statement can be embedded into: Experiment, 
* The `annealing` statement embeds statements:

[//]: # (keyword|statement_ask)
### ask 
#### Facets 
  
  * **`target`** (any type in [container, agent]), (omissible) : an expression that evaluates to an agent or a list of agents
  * `as` (species): an expression that evaluates to a species 
 	
#### Definition

Allows an agent, the sender agent (that can be the [Sections161#global world agent]), to ask another (or other) agent(s) to perform a set of statements. If the value of the target facet is nil or empty, the statement is ignored.

#### Usages

* Ask  a set of receiver agents, stored in a container, to perform a block of statements. The block is evaluated in the context of the agents' species

```
ask ${receiver_agents} {
     ${cursor}
}
```


* Ask  one agent to perform a block of statements. The block is evaluated in the context of the agent's species

```
ask ${one_agent} {
     ${cursor}
}
```


* If the species of the receiver agent(s) cannot be determined, it is possible to force it using the `as` facet. An error is thrown if an agent is not a direct or undirect instance of this species

```
ask${receiver_agent(s)} as: ${a_species_expression} {
     ${cursor}
}
```


* To ask a set of agents to do something only if they belong to a given species, the `of_species` operator can be used. If none of the agents belong to the species, nothing happens

```
ask ${receiver_agents} of_species ${species_name} {
     ${cursor}
}
```


* Any statement can be declared in the block statements. All the statements will be evaluated in the context of the receiver agent(s), as if they were defined in their species, which means that an expression like `self` will represent the receiver agent and not the sender. If the sender needs to refer to itself, some of its own attributes (or temporary variables) within the block statements, it has to use the keyword `myself`.

```
species animal {
    float energy <- rnd (1000) min: 0.0 {
    reflex when: energy > 500 { // executed when the energy is above the given threshold
         list<animal> others <- (animal at_distance 5); // find all the neighboring animals in a radius of 5 meters
         float shared_energy  <- (energy - 500) / length (others); // compute the amount of energy to share with each of them
         ask others { // no need to cast, since others has already been filtered to only include animals
              if (energy < 500) { // refers to the energy of each animal in others
                   energy <- energy + myself.shared_energy; // increases the energy of each animal
                   myself.energy <- myself.energy - myself.shared_energy; // decreases the energy of the sender
              }
         }
    }
}
```


* If the species of the receiver agent cannot be determined, it is possible to force it by casting the agent. Nothing happens if the agent cannot be casted to this species

#### Embedments
* The `ask` statement is of type: **Sequence of statements or action**
* The `ask` statement can be embedded into: chart, Behavior, Sequence of statements or action, 
* The `ask` statement embeds statements:

[//]: # (keyword|statement_aspect)
### aspect 
#### Facets 

  * `name` (an identifier), (omissible) : identifier of the aspect (it can be used in a display to identify which aspect should be used for the given species). Two special names can also be used: 'default' will allow this aspect to be used as a replacement for the default aspect defined in preferences; 'highlighted' will allow the aspect to be used when the agent is highlighted as a replacement for the default (application of a color) 
 	
#### Definition

Aspect statement is used to define a way to draw the current agent. Several aspects can be defined in one species. It can use attributes to customize each agent's aspect. The aspect is evaluate for each agent each time it has to be displayed.

#### Usages

* An example of use of the aspect statement:

```
species one_species {
	int a <- rnd(10);
	aspect aspect1 {
		if(a mod 2 = 0) { draw circle(a);}
		else {draw square(a);}
		draw text: "a= " + a color: #black size: 5;
	}
}
```



#### Embedments

[//]: # (keyword|statement_create)
### create 
#### Facets 

  * `species` (any type in [species, agent]), (omissible) : an expression that evaluates to a species, the species of the agents to be created. In the case of simulations, the name 'simulation', which represents the current instance of simulation, can also be used as a proxy to their species
  * `as` (species): 
  * `from` (any type): an expression that evaluates to a localized entity, a list of localized entities, a string (the path of a file), a file (shapefile, a .csv, a .asc or a OSM file) or a container returned by a request to a database
  * `header` (boolean): an expression that evaluates to a boolean, when creating agents from csv file, specify whether the file header is loaded
  * `number` (int): an expression that evaluates to an int, the number of created agents
  * `returns` (a new identifier): a new temporary variable name containing the list of created agents (a list, even if only one agent has been created)
  * `with` (map): an expression that evaluates to a map, for each pair the key is a species attribute and the value the assigned value 
 	
#### Definition

Allows an agent to create `number` agents of species `species`, to create agents of species `species` from a shapefile or to create agents of species `species` from one or several localized entities (discretization of the localized entity geometries).

#### Usages

* Its simple syntax to create `an_int` agents of species `a_species` is:

```
create a_species number: an_int;
create species_of(self) number: 5 returns: list5Agents;
5
```


* In GAML modelers can create agents of species `a_species  (with two attributes `type` and `nature` with types corresponding to the types of the shapefile attributes) from a shapefile `the_shapefile` while reading attributes 'TYPE_OCC' and 'NATURE' of the shapefile. One agent will be created by object contained in the shapefile:

```
create a_species from: the_shapefile with: [type:: 'TYPE_OCC', nature::'NATURE'];
```


* In order to create agents from a .csv file, facet `header` can be used to specified whether we can use columns header:

```
create toto from: "toto.csv" header: true with:[att1::read("NAME"), att2::read("TYPE")];
or
create toto from: "toto.csv" with:[att1::read(0), att2::read(1)]; //with read(int), the index of the column
```


* Similarly to the creation from shapefile, modelers can create agents from a set of geometries. In this case, one agent per geometry will be created (with the geometry as shape)

```
create species_of(self) from: [square(4),circle(4)]; 	// 2 agents have been created, with shapes respectively square(4) and circle(4)
```


* Created agents are initialized following the rules of their species. If one wants to refer to them after the statement is executed, the returns keyword has to be defined: the agents created will then be referred to by the temporary variable it declares. For instance, the following statement creates 0 to 4 agents of the same species as the sender, and puts them in the temporary variable children for later use.

```
create species (self) number: rnd (4) returns: children;
ask children {
        // ...
}
```


* If one wants to specify a special initialization sequence for the agents created, create provides the same possibilities as ask. This extended syntax is:

```
create a_species number: an_int {
     [statements]
}
```


* The same rules as in ask apply. The only difference is that, for the agents created, the assignments of variables will bypass the initialization defined in species. For instance:

```
create species(self) number: rnd (4) returns: children {
     set location <- myself.location + {rnd (2), rnd (2)}; // tells the children to be initially located close to me
     set parent <- myself; // tells the children that their parent is me (provided the variable parent is declared in this species) 
}
```


* Desprecated uses: 

```
// Simple syntax
create species: a_species number: an_int;

```


* If `number` equals 0 or species is not a species, the statement is ignored.

* The `create` statement is of type: **Sequence of statements or action**
* The `create` statement can be embedded into: Behavior, Sequence of statements or action, 
* The `create` statement embeds statements:

If false, the value will be diffused in the masked cells, but masked cells won't diffuse the value afterward (lost of signal). (default value : false)
  * `cycle_length` (int): the number of diffusion operation applied in one simulation step
  * `mask` (matrix): a matrix masking the diffusion (matrix created from a image for example). The cells corresponding to the values smaller than "-1" in the mask matrix will not diffuse, and the other will diffuse.

  * `propagation` (a label), takes values in: {diffusion, gradient}: represents both the way the signal is propagated and the way to treat multiple propagation of the same signal occurring at once from different places. If propagation equals 'diffusion', the intensity of a signal is shared between its neighbors with respect to 'proportion', 'variation' and the number of neighbors of the environment places (4, 6 or 8). I.e., for a given signal S propagated from place P, the value transmitted to its N neighbors is : S' = (S / N / proportion) - variation. The intensity of S is then diminished by S `*` proportion on P. In a diffusion, the different signals of the same name see their intensities added to each other on each place. If propagation equals 'gradient', the original intensity is not modified, and each neighbors receives the intensity : S / proportion - variation. If multiple propagation occur at once, only the maximum intensity is kept on each place. If 'propagation' is not defined, it is assumed that it is equal to 'diffusion'.
  * `proportion` (float): a diffusion rate
  * `radius` (int): a diffusion radius (in number of cells from the center)
  * `variation` (float): an absolute value to decrease at each neighbors 
 	
#### Definition

This statements allows a value to diffuse among a species on agents (generally on a grid) depending on a given diffusion matrix.

#### Usages

* A basic example of diffusion of the variable phero defined in the species cells, given a diffusion matrix math_diff is:

```
matrix<float> math_diff <- matrix([[1/9,1/9,1/9],[1/9,1/9,1/9],[1/9,1/9,1/9]]);
diffuse var: phero on: cells mat_diffu: math_diff;
```


* The diffusion can be masked by obstacles, created from a bitmap image:

```
diffuse var: phero on: cells mat_diffu: math_diff mask: mymask;
```


* A convenient way to have an uniform diffusion in a given radius is (which is equivalent to the above diffusion):

```
diffuse var: phero on: cells proportion: 1/9 radius: 1;
```

  * `refresh` (boolean): (openGL only) specify whether the display of the species is refreshed. (true by default, usefull in case of agents that do not move)
  * `selectable` (boolean): Indicates whether the agents present on this layer are selectable by the user. Default is true
  * `size` (point): extent of the layer in the screen from its position. Coordinates in [0,1[ are treated as percentages of the total surface, while coordinates > 1 are treated as absolute sizes in model units (i.e. considering the model occupies the entire view).

  * `text` (boolean): specify whether the attribute used to compute the elevation is displayed on each cells (false by default)
  * `texture` (any type in [boolean, file]): Either file  containing the texture image to be applied on the grid or, if true, the use of the image composed by the colors of the cells. If false, no texture is applied
  * `transparency` (float): the transparency rate of the agents (between 0 and 1, 1 means no transparency)
  * `triangulation` (boolean): specifies whther the cells will be triangulated: if it is false, they will be displayed as horizontal squares at a given elevation, whereas if it is true, cells will be triangulated and linked to neighbors in order to have a continuous surface (false by default) 
 	
#### Definition

`display_grid` is used using the `grid` keyword. It allows the modeler to display in an optimized way all cell agents of a grid (i.e. all agents of a species having a grid topology).

#### Usages

* The general syntax is:

```
display my_display {
   grid ant_grid lines: #black position: { 0.5, 0 } size: {0.5,0.5};
}
```


* To display a grid as a DEM:

```
display my_display {
    grid cell texture: texture_file text: false triangulation: true elevation: true;
}

Like in 'position', an elevation can be provided with the z coordinate, allowing to scale the layer in the 3 directions
  * `trace` (any type in [boolean, int]): Allows to aggregate the visualization of agents at each timestep on the display. Default is false. If set to an int value, only the last n-th steps will be visualized. If set to true, no limit of timesteps is applied.
  * `transparency` (float): the transparency rate of the agents (between 0 and 1, 1 means no transparency) 
 	
#### Definition

The `display_population` statement is used using the `species keyword`. It allows modeler to display all the agent of a given species in the current display. In particular, modeler can choose the aspect used to display them.

#### Usages

* The general syntax is:

```
display my_display {
   species species_name [additional options];
}
```


* Species can be superposed on the same plan (be careful with the order, the last one will be above all the others):

```
display my_display {
   species agent1 aspect: base;
   species agent2 aspect: base;
   species agent3 aspect: base;
}
```


* Each species layer can be placed at a different z value using the opengl display. position:{0,0,0} means the layer will be placed on the ground and position:{0,0,1} means it will be placed at an height equal to the maximum size of the environment.

```
display my_display type: opengl{
   species agent1 aspect: base ;
   species agent2 aspect: base position:{0,0,0.5};
   species agent3 aspect: base position:{0,0,1};
}
```

[//]: # (keyword|statement_do)
### do 
#### Facets 
  
  * **`action`** (an identifier), (omissible) : the name of an action or a primitive
  * `internal_function` (any type): 
  * `returns` (a new identifier): create a new variable and assign to it the result of the action
  * `with` (map): a map expression containing the parameters of the action 
 	
#### Definition

Allows the agent to execute an action or a primitive.  For a list of primitives available in every species, see this [BuiltIn161 page]; for the list of primitives defined by the different skills, see this [Skills161 page]. Finally, see this [Species161 page] to know how to declare custom actions.

#### Usages

* The simple syntax (when the action does not expect any argument and the result is not to be kept) is:

```
do name_of_action_or_primitive;
```


* In case the action expects one or more arguments to be passed, they are defined by using facets (enclosed tags or a map are now deprecated):

```
do name_of_action_or_primitive arg1: expression1 arg2: expression2;
```


* In case the result of the action needs to be made available to the agent, the action can be called with the agent calling the action (`self` when the agent itself calls the action) instead of `do`; the result should be assigned to a temporary variable:

```
type_returned_by_action result <- self name_of_action_or_primitive [];
```


* In case of an action expecting arguments and returning a value, the following syntax is used:

```
type_returned_by_action result <- self name_of_action_or_primitive [arg1::expression1, arg2::expression2];
```


* Deprecated uses: following uses of the `do` statement (still accepted) are now deprecated:

```
// Simple syntax: 
do action: name_of_action_or_primitive;

// In case the result of the action needs to be made available to the agent, the `returns` keyword can be defined; the result will then be referred to by the temporary variable declared in this attribute:
do name_of_action_or_primitive returns: result;
do name_of_action_or_primitive arg1: expression1 arg2: expression2 returns: result;
type_returned_by_action result <- name_of_action_or_primitive(self, [arg1::expression1, arg2::expression2]);

// In case the result of the action needs to be made available to the agent
let result <- name_of_action_or_primitive(self, []);

// In case the action expects one or more arguments to be passed, they can also be defined by using enclosed `arg` statements, or the `with` facet with a map of parameters:
do name_of_action_or_primitive with: [arg1::expression1, arg2::expression2];

or

do name_of_action_or_primitive {
     arg arg1 value: expression1;

	draw file(ant_shape_full) rotate: heading at: location size: 5
}
```


* Arrows can be drawn with any kind of geometry, using begin_arrow and end_arrow facets, combined with the empty: facet to specify whether it is plain or empty

```

#### Facets 

  * `name` (a new identifier), (omissible) : a temporary variable name
  * `from` (int): an int expression
  * `over` (any type in [container, point]): a list, point, matrix or map expression
  * `step` (int): an int expression
  * `times` (int): an int expression
  * `to` (int): an int expression
  * `while` (boolean): a boolean expression 
 	
#### Definition

Allows the agent to perform the same set of statements either a fixed number of times, or while a condition is true, or by progressing in a collection of elements or along an interval of integers. Be aware that there are no prevention of infinite loops. As a consequence, open loops should be used with caution, as one agent may block the execution of the whole model.

#### Usages

* The basic syntax for repeating a fixed number of times a set of statements is:

```
loop times: an_int_expression {
     // [statements]
}
```


* The basic syntax for repeating a set of statements while a condition holds is:

```
loop while: a_bool_expression {
     // [statements]
}
```


* The basic syntax for repeating a set of statements by progressing over a container of a point is:

```
loop a_temp_var over: a_collection_expression {
     // [statements]
}
```


* The basic syntax for repeating a set of statements while an index iterates over a range of values with a fixed step of 1 is:

```
loop a_temp_var from: int_expression_1 to: int_expression_2 {
     // [statements]
}
```


* The incrementation step of the index can also be chosen:

```
loop a_temp_var from: int_expression_1 to: int_expression_2 step: int_expression3 {
     // [statements]
}
```


* In these latter three cases, the name facet designates the name of a temporary variable, whose scope is the loop, and that takes, in turn, the value of each of the element of the list (or each value in the interval). For example, in the first instance of the "loop over" syntax :

```
int a <- 0;
loop i over: [10, 20, 30] {
     a <- a + i;
} // a now equals 60
```


* The second (quite common) case of the loop syntax allows one to use an interval of integers. The from and to facets take an integer expression as arguments, with the first (resp. the last) specifying the beginning (resp. end) of the inclusive interval (i.e. [to, from]). If the step is not defined, it is assumed to be equal to 1 or -1, depending on the direction of the range. If it is defined, its sign will be respected, so that a positive step will never allow the loop to enter a loop from i to j where i is greater than j

```
list the_list <-list (species_of (self));
loop i from: 0 to: length (the_list) - 1 {
     ask the_list at i {
        // ...
     }
} // every  agent of the list is asked to do something

```
switch 3 {
   match 1 {write "Match 1"; }

#### Definition

Allows the agent to replace a value in a container at a given position (in a list or a map) or for a given key (in a map). Note that the behavior and the type of the attributes depends on the specific kind of container.

#### Usages

* The allowed parameters configurations are the following ones:

```
put expr at: expr in: expr_container;
put all: expr in: expr_container;
```


* In the case of a list, the position should an integer in the bound of the list. The facet all: is used to replace all the elements of the list by the given value.

```
list<int> putList <- [1,2,3,4,5]; 	// putList equals [1,2,3,4,5]
put -10 at: 1 in: putList; 	// putList equals [1,-10,3,4,5]
put 10 all: true in: putList; 	// putList equals [10,10,10,10,10]
```


* In the case of a matrix, the position should be a point in the bound of the matrix. The facet all: is used to replace all the elements of the matrix by the given value.

```
matrix<int> putMatrix <- matrix([[0,1],[2,3]]); 	// putMatrix equals matrix([[0,1],[2,3]])
put -10 at: {1,1} in: putMatrix; 	// putMatrix equals matrix([[0,1],[2,-10]])
put 10 all: true in: putMatrix; 	// putMatrix equals matrix([[10,10],[10,10]])
```


* In the case of a map, the position should be one of the key values of the map. Notice that if the given key value does not exist in the map, the given pair key::value will be added to the map. The facet all is used to replace the value of all the pairs of the map.

```
map<string,int> putMap <- ["x"::4,"y"::7]; 	// putMap equals ["x"::4,"y"::7]
put -10 key: "y" in: putMap; 	// putMap equals ["x"::4,"y"::-10]
put -20 key: "z" in: putMap; 	// putMap equals ["x"::4,"y"::-10, "z"::-20]
put -30 all: true in: putMap; 	// putMap equals ["x"::-30,"y"::-30, "z"::-30]
```

  * **`name`** (an identifier), (omissible) : 
  * `aggregation` (a label), takes values in: {min, max}: the agregation method
  * `cycle_size_max` (int): minimal size of the considered cycles
  * `cycle_size_min` (int): maximal size of the considered cycles

  * `tabu_list_size_min` (int): minimal size of the tabu list 
 	
#### Definition

This algorithm is a simple implementation of the Reactive Tabu Search algorithm ((Battiti et al., 1993)). This Reactive Tabu Search is an enhance version of the Tabu search. It adds two new elements to the classic Tabu Search. The first one concerns the size of the tabu list: in the Reactive Tabu Search, this one is not constant anymore but it dynamically evolves according to the context. Thus, when the exploration process visits too often the same solutions, the tabu list is extended in order to favor the diversification of the search process. On the other hand, when the process has not visited an already known solution for a high number of iterations, the tabu list is shortened in order to favor the intensification of the search process. The second new element concerns the adding of cycle detection capacities. Thus, when a cycle is detected, the process applies random movements in order to break the cycle. See [batch161 the batch dedicated page].

#### Usages

* As other batch methods, the basic syntax of the reactive_tabu statement uses `method reactive_tabu` instead of the expected `reactive_tabu name: id` : 

```
method reactive_tabu [facet: value];
```


* For example: 

```
method reactive_tabu iter_max: 50 tabu_list_size_init: 5 tabu_list_size_min: 2 tabu_list_size_max: 10 nb_tests_wthout_col_max: 20 cycle_size_min: 2 cycle_size_max: 20 maximize: food_gathered;

### release 
#### Facets 
  
  * **`target`** (any type in [agent, list]), (omissible) : an expression that is evaluated as an agent or a list of the agents to be released
  * `as` (species): an expression that is evaluated as a species in which the micro-agent will be released

  * `returns` (a new identifier): a new variable containing a list of the newly released agent(s) 
 	
#### Definition

Allows an agent to release its micro-agent(s). The preliminary for an agent to release its micro-agents is that species of these micro-agents are sub-species of other species (cf. [Species161#Nesting_species Nesting species]). The released agents won't be micro-agents of the calling agent anymore. Being released from a macro-agent, the micro-agents will change their species and host (macro-agent).

#### Usages

* We consider the following species. Agents of "C" species can be released from a "B" agent to become agents of "A" species. Agents of "D" species cannot be released from the "A" agent because species "D" has no parent species.

```
species A {
...
}
species B {
...
   species C parent: A {
   ...
   }
   species D {
   ...
   }
...
}
```


* To release all "C" agents from a "B" agent, agent "C" has to execute the following statement. The "C" agent will change to "A" agent. The won't consider "B" agent as their macro-agent (host) anymore. Their host (macro-agent) will the be the host (macro-agent) of the "B" agent.

```
release list(C);
```


* The modeler can specify the new host and the new species of the released agents:

```
release list (C) as: new_species in: new host;
```

  * `item` (any type), (omissible) : any expression to remove from the container
  * `all` (any type): an expression that evaluates to a container. If it is true and if the value a list, it removes the first instance of each element of the list. If it is true and the value is not a container, it will remove all instances of this value.
  * `edge` (any type): Indicates that the item to remove should be considered as an edge of the receiving graph
  * `index` (any type): any expression, the key at which to remove the element from the container
  * `key` (any type): any expression, the key at which to remove the element from the container
  * `node` (any type): Indicates that the item to remove should be considered as a node of the receiving graph
  * `vertex` (any type):  
 	
#### Definition

Allows the agent to remove an element from a container (a list, matrix, map...).

#### Usages

* This statement should be used in the following ways, depending on the kind of container used and the expected action on it:

```
remove expr from: expr_container;
remove index: expr from: expr_container;
remove key: expr from: expr_container;
remove all: expr from: expr_container;
```


* In the case of list, the facet `item:` is used to remove the first occurence of a given expression, whereas `all` is used to remove all the occurrences of the given expression.

```
list<int> removeList <- [3,2,1,2,3];
remove 2 from: removeList; 	// removeList equals [3,1,2,3]
remove 3 all: true from: removeList; 	// removeList equals [1,2]
remove index: 1 from: removeList; 	// removeList equals [1]
```


* In the case of map, the facet `key:` is used to remove the pair identified by the given key.

```
map<string,int> removeMap <- ["x"::5, "y"::7, "z"::7];
remove key: "x" from: removeMap; 	// removeMap equals ["y"::7, "z"::7]
remove 7 all: true from: removeMap; 	// removeMap equals map([])
```


* In addition, a map a be managed as a list with pair key as index. Given that, facets item:, all: and index: can be used in the same way:

```
map<string,int> removeMapList <- ["x"::5, "y"::7, "z"::7, "t"::5];
remove 7 from: removeMapList; 	// removeMapList equals ["x"::5, "z"::7, "t"::5]
remove [5,7] all: true from: removeMapList; 	// removeMapList equals ["t"::5]
remove index: "t" from: removeMapList; 	// removeMapList equals map([])
```


* In the case of a graph, both edges and nodes can be removes using node: and edge facets. If a node is removed, all edges to and from this node are also removed.

```
graph removeGraph <- as_edge_graph([{1,2}::{3,4},{3,4}::{5,6}]);
remove node: {1,2} from: removeGraph;
remove node(1,2) from: removeGraph;
list var <- removeGraph.vertices; 	// var equals [{3,4},{5,6}]
list var <- removeGraph.edges; 	// var equals [polyline({3,4}::{5,6})]
remove edge: {3,4}::{5,6} from: removeGraph;
remove edge({3,4},{5,6}) from: removeGraph;
list var <- removeGraph.vertices; 	// var equals [{3,4},{5,6}]
list var <- removeGraph.edges; 	// var equals []
```


* In the case of an agent or a shape, `remove` allows to remove an attribute from the attributes map of the receiver. However, for agents, it will only remove attributes that have been added dynamically, not the ones defined in the species or in its built-in parent.

```
global {
   init {
      create speciesRemove;
      speciesRemove sR <- speciesRemove(0); 	// sR.a now equals 100
      remove key:"a" from: sR; 	// sR.a now equals nil
   }
}

species speciesRemove {
   int a <- 100; 
}
```

  * `schedules` (container): A container of agents (a species, a dynamic list, or a combination of species and containers) , which represents which agents will be actually scheduled when the population is scheduled for execution. For instance, 'species a schedules: (10 among a)' will result in a population that schedules only 10 of its own agents every cycle. 'species b schedules: []' will prevent the agents of 'b' to be scheduled. Note that the scope of agents covered here can be larger than the population, which allows to build complex scheduling controls; for instance, defining 'global schedules: [] {...} species b schedules: []; species c schedules: b + world; ' allows to simulate a model where the agents of b are scheduled first, followed by the world, without even having to create an instance of c.
  * `skills` (list): The list of skills that will be made available to the instances of this species. Each new skill provides attributes and actions that will be added to the ones defined in this species
  * `topology` (topology): The topology of the population of agents defined by this species. In case of nested species, it can for example be the shape of the macro-agent. In case of grid or graph species, the topology is automatically computed and cannot be redefined
  * `torus` (boolean): is the topology toric (defaut: false). Needs to be defined on the global species.
  * `use_individual_shapes` (boolean): (grid only),(true by default). Allows to specify whether or not the agents of the grid will have distinct geometries. If set to false, they will all have simpler proxy geometries
  * `use_neighbors_cache` (boolean): (grid only),(true by default). Allows to turn on or off the use of the neighbors cache used for grids. Note that if a diffusion of variable occurs, GAMA will emit a warning and automatically switch to a caching version
  * `use_regular_agents` (boolean): (grid only),(true by default). Allows to specify if the agents of the grid are regular agents (like those of any other species) or minimal ones (which can't have sub-populations, can't inherit from a regular species, etc.)
  * `width` (int): (grid only), the width of the grid (in terms of agent number) 
 	
#### Definition

The species statement allows modelers to define new species in the model. `global` and `grid` are speciel cases of species: `global` being the definition of the global agent (which has automatically one instance, world) and `grid` being a species with a grid topology.

#### Usages

* Here is an example of a species definition with a FSM architecture and the additional skill moving:

```
species ant skills: [moving] control: fsm {

species node_agent mirrors: list(bug) parent: graph_node edge_species: edge_agent {
```


* The definition of the single grid of a model will automatically create gridwidth x gridheight agents:

```
grid ant_grid width: gridwidth height: gridheight file: grid_file neighbors: 8 use_regular_agents: false { 
```


* Using a file to initialize the grid can replace width/height facets:

```
grid ant_grid file: grid_file neighbors: 8 use_regular_agents: false {

```
	state s_init initial: true {
		enter { write "Enter in" + state; }
			write "Enter in" + state;
		}

		write state;

		transition to: s1 when: (cycle > 2) {

### switch 
#### Facets 
  
  * **`value`** (any type), (omissible) : an expression 
 	
#### Definition

The "switch... match" statement is a powerful replacement for imbricated "if ... else ..." constructs. All the blocks that match are executed in the order they are defined. The block prefixed by default is executed only if none have matched (otherwise it is not).

#### Usages

* The prototypical syntax is as follows:

```
switch an_expression {
        match value1 {...}
        match_one [value1, value2, value3] {...}
        match_between [value1, value2] {...}
        default {...}
}
```


* Example:

```
switch 3 {
   match 1 {write "Match 1"; }
   match 2 {write "Match 2"; }
   match 3 {write "Match 3"; }
   match_one [4,4,6,3,7]  {write "Match one_of"; }
   match_between [2, 4] {write "Match between"; }
   default {write "Match Default"; }

#### Usages

* As other batch methods, the basic syntax of the tabu statement uses `method tabu` instead of the expected `tabu name: id` : 

```
method tabu [facet: value];
```


* For example: 

```
method tabu iter_max: 50 tabu_list_size: 5 maximize: food_gathered;

[//]: # (keyword|statement_test)
### test 
#### Facets 

  * `name` (an identifier), (omissible) : identifier of the test 
 	
#### Definition

The test statement allows modeler to define a set of assertions that will be tested. Before the execution of the embedded set of instructions, if a setup is defined in the species, model or experiment, it is executed. In a test, if one assertion fails, the evaluation of other assertions continue (if GAMA is configured in the preferences that the program does not stop at the first exception).

#### Usages

* An example of use:

```
species Tester {
    // set of attributes that will be used in test

    setup {
        // [set of instructions... in particular initializations]
    }

    test t1 {
       // [set of instructions, including asserts]

#### Definition

In an FSM architecture, `transition` specifies the next state of the life cycle. The transition occurs when the condition is fulfilled. The embedded statements are executed when the transition is triggered.

#### Usages

* In the following example, the transition is executed when after 2 steps:

```
	state s_init initial: true {
		write state;
		transition to: s1 when: (cycle > 2) {
			write "transition s_init -> s1";

  * `action` (an identifier): the identifier of the action to be executed. This action should be accessible in the context in which it is defined (an experiment, the global section or a species). A special case is allowed to maintain the compatibility with older versions of GAMA, when the user_command is declared in an experiment and the action is declared in 'global'. In that case, all the simulations managed by the experiment will run the action in response to the user executing the command
  * `color` (rgb): The color of the button to display
  * `continue` (boolean): Whether or not the button, when clicked, should dismiss the user panel it is defined in. Has no effect in other contexts (menu, parameters, inspectors)

### user_panel 
#### Facets 
  
  * **`name`** (an identifier), (omissible) : 
  * `initial` (boolean):  
 	
#### Definition

It is the basic behavior of the user control architecture (it is similar to state for the FSM architecture). This user_panel translates, in the interface, in a semi-modal view that awaits the user to choose action buttons, change attributes of the controlled agent, etc. Each user_panel, like a state in FSM, can have a enter and exit sections, but it is only defined in terms of a set of user_commands which describe the different action buttons present in the panel.

#### Usages

* The general syntax is for example:

```
user_panel default initial: true {
	user_input 'Number' returns: number type: int <- 10;
	ask (number among list(cells)){ do die; }
	transition to: "Advanced Control" when: every (10);

#### Definition

`using` is a statement that allows to set the topology to use by its sub-statements. They can gather it by asking the scope to provide it.

#### Usages

* All the spatial operations are topology-dependent (e.g. neighbors are not the same in a continuous and in a grid topology). So `using` statement allows modelers to specify the topology in which the spatial operation will be computed.

```
float dist <- 0.0;
using topology(grid_ant) {
	d (self.location distance_to target.location);
}
```
