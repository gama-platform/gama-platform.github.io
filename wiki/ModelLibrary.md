Here is the list of models accessible when you download GAMA. Do not hesitate to consult those models to have an idea of the possibilities of the platform.

Models are divided within 5 categories :

* [Features](references#Features) : very short models designed to present the differents features of the platform.
* [Syntax](references#Syntax) : some gaml files in order to show you the syntax to use for basic things (casting, containers manipulation...).
* [Toy Models](references#ToyModels) : some pre-made models designed to answer to concrete problematics.
* [Tutorials](tutorials) : models build in the [tutorial section](tutorials#ThematicTutorials).
* [Additionnal Plugins](references#AdditionnalPlugins) : models using particular additionnal plugins.
