# Optimizing Models

Now you are becoming more comfortable with GAML, it is time to think about how the runtime works, to be able to run some more optimized models. Indeed, if you already tried to write some models by yourself using GAML, you could have notice that the execution time depends a lot of how you implemented your model !

We will first present you in this part some [**runtime concepts**](RuntimeConcepts) (and present you the species facet [`scheduler`](RuntimeConcepts#schedule-agents)), and we will then show you some [**tips to optimize your models**](OptimizingModels) (how to increase performances using [scheduler](OptimizingModels#scheduling), [grids](OptimizingModels#grid), [displays](OptimizingModels#displays) and how to [choose your operators](OptimizingModels#operators)).
