model based on the one proposed by (Raimbault et al., 2014): At each simulation step the nb_plots_to_build empty plots with the highest constructability are built The constructability is computed from 3 criteria: the density of construction in the neighborhood, the distance to a road, the distance to the city center (using the road network). 


Code of the model : 

```
